BUSINESS INTERCOURSE</h2>
<hr class="small" />
<h3>CHAPTER I
<br />
 COMMERCIAL CORRESPONDENCE</h3>

<h4><b>A. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS</b></h4>

<p>Considering the vast amount of business transacted by correspondence
between the parties interested, Letter-Writing seems only second in
importance to bookkeeping. Merchants and others living at a distance
from the wholesale centers, usually order and remit by letter. It may
be that an error has occurred and needs correction. Credit is to be
asked, references given, and a multitude of other matters call for
adjustment through correspondence. To write every conceivable variety
and shade of meaning, expressing the proper thought in the most fitting
and appropriate language, is indeed a rare and valuable accomplishment.
And when the proper language takes on the graceful and businesslike
air of the well-written letter, with its several parts harmoniously
arranged, it is a combination of brain and skill which can hardly be
overestimated.</p>

<p>This subject, therefore, naturally divides itself into two parts: <i>The
Mechanical Structure</i>, and the <i>Literature of a Letter</i>. The former,
being the less difficult, will be first considered.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
<b>The Structure of a Business Letter.</b></p>

<p class="noin">Consists in the arrangement of its several parts, with a view to the
most harmonious effect. Whenever typewriting is not used, excellent
penmanship is very desirable, but not absolutely essential. The
penmanship may indeed be poor, but the arrangement of the several
parts of the letter, the neatness, and finish, may be such as to give
it an attractive appearance, while, on the other hand, the letter may
be clothed in the most elegant penmanship, and yet the construction
be such as to stamp its author as a careless and indifferent person,
devoid of precision and order.</p>

<p>Not one great thing, but many little things, carefully watched and
attentively practiced, make up the structure and dress of a business
letter, and give it a businesslike air. The penmanship should be a
neat, strong hand, very plain and legible, and devoid of all flourish.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Paper and Envelope.</b></p>

<p>The paper and envelopes used in business correspondence should be of a
good durable quality, and a white color is preferable. Cheap materials
are not only unsatisfactory to the writer, but may give the reader an
unfavorable impression, which would be an injury far exceeding the cost
of the best stationery for a lifetime. Persons form impressions from
very little things sometimes.</p>

<p>The size of a letter sheet in business correspondence should be
about 8½ x 11 inches. This sheet affords a sufficient space for a
communication of ordinary length, to be written on one side only, which
is essential in case the letter is copied in a letter press. A sheet of
paper, note size (5 x 8), is oftentimes used for brief communications
of no special importance, and not designed to be filed for future
reference. Among professional men the note paper is extensively used,
but with business men the letter size is considered preferable.</p>

<p>The envelope should correspond in size to that of the letter sheet,
and should be a trifle longer than one-half the length of the sheet.
Thus, in a sheet 8½ x 11 inches, one-half the length of the sheet is
5½ inches, and this requires the length of the envelope to be about
5¾ inches. Its width is usually about 3¼ inches. Avoid the use of
fancy colored and fancy shaped paper and envelopes. These may not be
objectionable in social correspondence among ladies (see <a href="#Page_173">Part IV, chap.
I</a>), but the importance of business affairs does not admit of such
display.</p>

<b>The Heading.</b></p>

<p>The nature of the business is usually printed or engraved at the top of
the letter page, together with street, number and city, thus leaving
only the date to be inserted to complete the heading.</p>

<p>In case the heading of the letter is to be entirely written, it should
be placed so as to occupy the right-hand half of the first two lines
at the top of the page. If, however, the letter is to be a very brief
one, occupying only three or four lines, the heading may then be placed
lower down on the sheet, so as to bring the body of the letter about
the center of the sheet.</p>

<p class="right"><i><big>365 Wabash Avenue,<br />
Chicago, May 5, 1900.</big></i></p>

<p>Writing from a large city, the heading should contain the street and
number. Your correspondent, in directing his answer, will rely on the
address given in your letter. Never be guilty of the blunder frequently
committed, of placing a part of the heading under the signature.</p>

<p>The second line of the heading should begin a little farther to the
right than the first line, as seen above:</p>

<div class="bbox">
 <p><span class="floatl"><small>EDWARD P. LEWIS.</small></span>
  <span class="floatr"><small>HENRY T. ROBERTS.</small></span></p>

          <p class="center p2"><big>LEWIS &amp; ROBERTS,</big></p>
    <p class="center">Booksellers, Newsdealers and Stationers,</p>
          <p class="center">1320 Broadway,</p>

         <p class="right"><i>New York, .......... 19.....</i></p></div>

<p class="center"><i>Specimen of Printed or Engraved Heading.</i></p>

<p>If the writer has a box at the post office, and wishes his mail
delivered there, he may head his letter as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><i><big>P. O. Box, 2015</big>,</i><br />
<span class="margina"><i><big>Philadelphia, August 10, 19&mdash;</big>.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>Writing from the principal cities of the United States, it is not
necessary to make the name of the State a part of the heading, as that
is supposed to be known and understood, but with smaller cities the
name of the State also should be given. In writing from an obscure town
or village, not only the State should be given, but the county as well.</p>

<p class="center"><i><big>St. Charles, Kane County, Ill.,</big></i><br />
<span class="margina"><i><big>November 15, 19&mdash;.</big></i></span></p>

<p>The punctuation of the heading and other parts of the letter is of
great importance, and something which can be learned by a little
attention on the part of any one in examining the forms here given.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Margin.</b></p>

<p>A margin three-quarters of an inch in width should be left on the side
of the letter, as shown in the diagram. This is convenient for any mark
or memorandum which your correspondent may desire to make concerning
anything contained in the letter, but its greater value lies in the
open, airy, and cheerful dress which it imparts to the missive. A too
narrow margin conveys the idea of stinginess, as if to economize paper,
while an irregular or zigzag margin conveys the idea of carelessness
or want of precision. On a sheet of note paper, the margin may be only
one-half inch in width, thus making it proportionate to the size of the
sheet.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Address.</b></p>

<p>On the next line below the heading, that is, the third line from the
top of the sheet, and beginning at the left margin, should be placed
the <i>Address</i>, which consists of the name of the person to whom the
letter is written, together with his titles, if any, and his place of
residence or business.</p>

<p><i><big>Messrs. Duncan Bros. &amp; Co.</big></i><br />
<span class="margina"><i><big>Peoria, Ill.</big></i></span></p>
<p class="marginb"><i><big>Gentlemen</big></i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>Or, if the letter is written to a person living or doing business in a
large city, thus:</p>

<p class="addr"><i>Mr. James P. Hutchins,</i><br />
<span class="margina"><i>Counselor &amp; Attorney-at-law,</i></span><br />
<span class="marginb"><i>510 Chestnut St., Philadelphia, Pa.</i></span></p>

<p class="center"><big>Dear Sir:</big></p>

<p>The names and residence should not be allowed to extend further to the
right than about the center of the sheet, thus leaving an open space
between this and the heading of your letter. In case the names or place
of residence should be so long as to require it, they may be placed
thus:</p>

<p class="addr noin">
<i>Messrs. Pollard, Taylor, Jones</i><br />
<span class="margina"><i>&amp; Duncan, St. Louis, Mo.</i></span></p>

<p class="addr"><i>Gentlemen:</i></p>

<p>The words <i>Dear Sir</i> or <i>Gentlemen</i> are sometimes placed farther to
the left, as in the above example, but most business men in their
correspondence place this complimentary address with reference to the
words above them, about three-quarters of an inch farther to the right,
as shown below:</p>

<p class="noin addr"><i>Arthur P. Dillingham, Esq.,</i><br />
<span class="marginleft "><i>210 Erie St., Boston.</i></span></p>

<p class="addr margin"><i>Dear Sir:</i></p>

<p>The custom of placing the address beneath the body instead of at the
beginning of the letter is not much in vogue in business circles in
this country, most business men preferring to place the name and
address at the head of the sheet, and then write it as if they were
talking to the person himself. When, however, the address is placed
below the letter, it should occupy the same position as to the margin,
etc., as if placed at the beginning. The custom is borrowed from the
English, and its use is confined mostly to government officials,
professional men, and social intercourse.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span><b>Body of the Letter.</b></p>

<p>This constitutes the written message. It should begin on the same
line with the words, <i>Dear Sir</i> or <i>Gentlemen</i>, leaving after these
words a small space. In case the place of residence or business is not
written in the address, then the complimentary address of <i>Dear Sir</i> or
<i>Gentlemen</i> will be placed on the next line under the name, or fourth
line from the top of the sheet, and the letter will begin on the fifth
line from the top, thus:</p>

<p class="addr"><i>Mr. Frank L. Robinson,</i></p>

<p class="addr margin"><i>Dear Sir:&mdash;</i></p>

<p class="addr marginsec"><i>In answer to your favor&mdash;&mdash;</i></p>

<p>Sometimes, for the sake of convenience, and the saving of labor, the
letter head has printed in the left corner, above the address, a blank
form of memorandum, as follows:</p>

<table summary="form">
<tr>
<td>Referring to</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="align"><big>}</big></td>
 <td rowspan="2" class="align"><small>OR </small></td>
<td>In reply to</td>   <td rowspan="2" class="align"><big>}</big></td></tr>
<tr><td>yours of ... </td>      <td> your favor of ...</td></tr></table>

<p class="noin">and after this introduction the writer is able speedily to get at the
marrow of his letter, without acknowledging the receipt of a former
communication.</p>

<p>The body of the letter should be divided into as many paragraphs as
there are distinct subjects in the letter, or a new paragraph should be
commenced at every change of the subject. The habit which some persons
have of tacking one subject to the end of another, and thus making a
letter one continuous paragraph of mixed-up information, instructions
and requests, is extremely objectionable. It destroys the force of what
is said, instead of fixing each thought clearly on the mind of the
reader; it leaves him confused, and he reads a second time and tries
to get his ideas fixed and systematized, or he throws aside the letter
until he has more time in which to study it and get the meaning clear.</p>

<p>If the letter is long and is really concerning only one subject, then
it may properly be divided into paragraphs by separating the different
divisions of the subject, and giving a paragraph to each. These should
be arranged in their logical order. Wherever the letter is to contain
numerous paragraphs, to avoid omitting any of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
 items it is best to
jot them down on a slip of paper, then embody them in the letter in
their natural order.</p>

<p>The first word of each paragraph should be indented, or moved in from
the margin, usually about the width of the margin. Thus, if the margin
is three-fourths of an inch in width, the paragraph should begin
three-fourths of an inch from the margin. Some writers, however, prefer
to commence the first word of the paragraph an inch from the margin,
and it is really not so essential what the distance is, provided it
be uniform, and all the paragraphs begin alike. A little attention
is necessary here. In ordering goods, make each article a separate
paragraph.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Complimentary Closing and Signature.</b></p>

<p>The complimentary closing consists of such words as <i>Yours truly</i>,
<i>Respectfully</i>, etc., and should be placed on the next line beneath
the last one occupied by the body of the letter, commencing a little
to the right of the middle. The signature should be placed underneath
the words of respect, and begin still a little farther to the right.
Thus the conclusion of the letter will correspond in position and
arrangement with the heading.</p>

<p class="addr"><span class="margin"><i>Yours truly,</i></span><br />
<span class="marginsec"><i>Thomas Smyth.</i></span></p>

<p>The language of the complimentary closing should be governed by
the relation between the parties, and should correspond with the
complimentary address. The first letter, even between strangers,
now generally commences with <i>Dear Sir</i> and ends with the word
<i>Respectfully</i>. After the exchange of a few letters and a sort of
business acquaintance may be said to exist between the correspondents,
then <i>My Dear Sir</i>, and <i>Yours truly</i>, may properly be introduced. A
little more cordial would be such a conclusion as the following:</p>

<p class="addr"><span class="margin"><i>Yours very truly,</i></span><br />
<span class="marginsec"><i>Jones, Smith &amp; Robinson.</i></span></p>

<p>The man of business is apt, however, to have one stereotyped beginning
and ending to all his letters, and seldom stops to discriminate between
strangers and old customers in this respect. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>Often the conclusion may
be connected to the closing paragraph with perfect grace and ease thus:</p>

<p class="addr"><i>Hoping to receive the goods without delay, I remain,</i></p>

<p class="addr center"><i>Respectfully,</i><br />
<span class="margina"><i>Melville R. Johnson.</i></span></p>

<p>In the signature of a letter, especial care should be exercised.
Bear in mind that names of persons are not governed by the rules of
spelling, and words which precede or follow proper names will not aid
us in deciphering them if they are poorly written.</p>

<p>The young person who would learn to write a good business letter
should, with pen, ink and suitable paper begin to practice faithfully
after the above model. If necessary, write and re-write it a dozen
times or more, until your letter resembles it closely. Then take any
of the models for business letters given in this book, and, with this
specimen in front of you, write a letter which will conform with the
foregoing sample in appearance and dress. Write the same matter over
again, and improve it in its defects. Criticise each line and word.
See that no words or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span> letters are omitted, and that the punctuation is
according to the models in this volume. Eliminate all ungainly letters,
see that each of them rests on the line, and that, withal, your page is
clean and regular.</p>

<p>The person who will thus devote a little earnest study and practice
may early acquire the valuable accomplishment of writing a pleasing
business letter, so far as the mechanical structure goes. For the
contents, the model letter will also furnish the necessary practical
points.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Typewritten Letters.</b></p>

<p>It must be stated here that all the above principles, rules and
recommendations apply to type-written letters, as well as to their
contents as to general arrangement of the text.</p>

<p>It is considered absolutely bad form and almost impertinent, to use a
typewriter in social correspondence. The writing machine is reserved
exclusively for business or official correspondence.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Addressing the Envelope.</b></p>

<p>After the letter is finished, and before it is copied on the letter
press, the envelope should be addressed. As before stated, the
directions on the envelope must conform to the address at the beginning
of the letter, hence the necessity for addressing the envelope before
the letter is folded.</p>

<p>The first line of the address of the envelope should consist of the
name of the person or firm to whom the letter is written, together with
any appropriate titles, and should be written across or a little below
the middle of the envelope, but never above it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
 beginning near the left edge. The space between this first line and the
bottom of the envelope should be about equally divided among the other
lines, each of which begins still farther to the right than the one
above (see page <a href="#Page_26">26</a>).</p>

<div class="bbox">
 <p class="center p2"><i>Messrs. Bradley, Tomlinson &amp; Co.,</i></p>

           <p class="center"><i>410 Broadway,</i></p>

                <p class="right"><i>New York City.</i></p></div>

<p>When writing to a person in a large city the number and street should
be a part of the address, and may be placed as in the above form, or in
the left-hand lower corner as follows:</p>

<div class="bbox">
      <p class="center p2"><i>Messrs. Laird &amp; Lee</i>,</p>

             <p class="center"><i>Publishers</i>,</p>

                <p class="right">Chicago, Ill.</p>
 <p><i>263-65 Wabash Ave.</i></p></div>

<p>In case the letter is addressed in care of any one, this should be
inserted in the lower left corner. In a letter of introduction, the
words <i>Introducing Mr. John Smith</i>, or similar words, should be placed
in this corner.</p>

<p>Letters addressed to small towns or villages should bear the name of
the county, as follows:</p>

          <div class="bbox"><p class="center p2"><i>Mr. David Lyons</i>,</p>

             <p class="righti2"><i>Washington</i>,</p>

             <p class="righti3"><i>Porter County</i>,</p>

 <p><span class="floatl"><i>P. O. Box No. 37.</i></span>      <span class="floatr"><i>Ala.</i></span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>Or the name of the county may be placed in the lower left corner. The
post office box number is usually placed in that place.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Folding a Letter.</b></p>

<p>Having written an excellent letter, and faultlessly addressed the
envelope, all may be easily stamped as unbusinesslike, and spoiled, by
improperly performing so simple a part as the folding. Remember this
excellent rule that, whatever is worth doing is worth doing well.</p>

<p>With the letter sheet lying before you, turn the bottom edge up so that
it lies along with the top edge, thus making a fold in the middle,
which press down with the thumb nail or with a paper folder. Then fold
the right edge over so that it falls two-thirds the distance across the
sheet, and press down the edge. Next fold the left edge of the sheet
over to the right, breaking the fold at the edge of the part folded
over just before.</p>

<p>In case a check, note, draft, bill or currency is to be sent by letter,
it should be placed on the upper half of the sheet as it lies open,
and then the letter should be folded the same as if it were not there.
This will fold the paper or document in the letter so that it will be
difficult to extract it while being transmitted in the mails, and so
that it will not be dropped or lost in opening the letter.</p>

<p>The letter is now folded so that it will be of equal thickness in every
part of the envelope. Insert the edge last folded in the envelope
first, with the original edges of the sheet at the end of the envelope
which the stamp is on; when taken from the envelope the letter will
then be proper side up.</p>

<p class="center"><b>The Literature of a Letter.</b></p>

<p>To be able to compose a letter requires more ability than to give it
the proper arrangement and mechanical appearance. A mind well stored
with useful knowledge as well as command of language, is necessary in
writing a letter on general subjects. The strictly business letter
requires a thorough understanding of the facts concerning which the
letter is written, and these facts to be set forth in plain and
unmistakable language. All display of rhetoric or flourish of words
is entirely out of place in the sober, practical letter of business.
The proper use of capital letters, punctuation, and correct spelling
is essential to the well-written letter, and with a little care and
perseverance may be easily acquired.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span><b>Arrangement of Items.</b></p>

<p>As stated before, each item or subject in a letter should be embraced
in a separate paragraph. These should be arranged in the order in
which they would naturally come, either in point of time, importance,
or as regards policy. Never begin a letter abruptly with a complaint,
but rather bring in all unpleasant subjects toward the close. In an
answer to a letter of inquiry, take up the questions as they are asked,
indicate first what the question is, and then state clearly the answer.
The first paragraph should acknowledge the receipt of the communication
now to be answered, giving date and indicating its nature and contents,
thus:</p>

<p class="addr"><i>Your favor of the 10th instant concerning damaged goods received,
etc.</i></p>

<p>The closing paragraph frequently begins with such words as <i>Hoping</i>,
<i>Trusting</i>, <i>Awaiting</i>, <i>Thanking</i>, or similar expressions, and is
complimentary in its tone and designed as a courtesy.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Brevity.</b></p>

<p>Business letters should be brief and to the point. The best letter
states clearly all the facts in the fewest words. Brevity is not
inconsistent with a long letter, as so much may need to be said as to
require a long letter, but all repetitions, lengthy statements and
multiplication of words should be avoided. Use short sentences, and
make every word mean something. Short sentences are more forcible, and
more easily understood or remembered, than long drawn-out utterances.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Style.</b></p>

<p>By style we mean the tone, air, or manner of expression. Dignity
and strength should characterize the style of the business letter.
No ornament of expression or eloquence of language is necessary or
appropriate in a correspondence between business men. Come to your
meaning at once. State the facts. Let every sentence bristle with
points.</p>

<p>The successful business man must possess energy, decision, and force,
and these qualities should be conspicuous in his correspondence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
order to command respect. Never use loose or slang expressions. The
business man should be a <i>gentleman</i>. Indulge in no display of superior
knowledge or education, but temper each paragraph with respect and
deference to others.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Ordering Goods.</b></p>

<p>In ordering goods of any kind, care should be used to state very
explicitly the color, size, quality, and quantity of the articles
desired. If manufactured goods, the name of the manufacturer, or his
trade mark or brand, should be given. Also state when you desire the
goods shipped, and by what route. If by freight or express, state what
freight line or express company. Sometimes it is appropriate to write
simply, "By cheapest route."</p>

<p class="center"><b>Sending Money by Letter.</b></p>

<p>Paper currency should seldom be trusted to pass through the mails,
as the liability to loss is too great. Better send draft on New York
or Chicago; P. O. or express, money order, or funds in a registered
letter, and in every case the amount of the remittance should be stated
in the letter, and also whether by draft or otherwise sent. The letter
may become important evidence in regard to payment at some future time.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Instructions.</b></p>

<p>In giving instructions to agents, manufacturers and others, let each
order occupy a separate paragraph. State in unmistakable language the
instructions desired to be conveyed. Whenever necessary or desirable,
a diagram or plan should be enclosed in the letter. Cautions and
complaints, if any, should be clearly set forth in paragraphs near the
close of the letter.</p>

<p class="center"><b>A Dunning Letter.</b></p>

<p>State when the debt was contracted, the amount, the fact of it having
been long past due, the necessity for immediate payment, and any other
facts depending on the peculiarities of the case, which it may seem
best to make use of, such as promises to pay, which have not been
met; the inconvenience as well as injury and distrust caused by such
irregularities, etc.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span><b>The Importance of Copying Letters.</b></p>

<p>No experienced business man ever allows a letter to leave his office
before it has been copied in a letter book kept for the purpose.
Although this operation is especially important whenever the statements
in the letter contain any clause obligating the writer, it is better
to have the whole correspondence copied, as no one knows, ahead, the
importance that the most apparently insignificant signed statement may
have in the future.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Answering Promptly.</b></p>

<p>Nothing does more good to a young business man starting on his own
account, than to answer promptly all letters addressed to him, be
they of ever so little importance. Older firms will at once recognize
in this single fact of promptness in answering letters the excellent
business habits that make men successful. To delay answering, when
it is not done for a special purpose, and is simply the result of
negligence, may often be of the greatest consequence, and injure the
credit as well as the standing of the writer.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Employers and Employes.</b></p>

<p>The correspondence between employers and employes ought to be
characterized by kindness and firmness on the part of the first,
and proper respect on the part of the second. Neither harshness nor
subserviency are to be desired, as they quickly culminate in disrespect
or contempt, or both. Applications for position must be carefully
worded, and the letters written with minute attention to detail, as
many a start in life has been made and marred by a first letter from
would-be employe to employer.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Various Notices</b></p>

<p class="noin">and communications of a general character have to be sent, at times, by
business houses going through the different periods of organization,
prosperity, adversity, dissolution and liquidation. These announcements
are worded in a more or less stereotyped style, and we insert, in this
volume, the models for use in such cases.</p>

him. Although I am aware you must have many applications of this

educated in Germany, which may be in his favor, as he is considered a

he has no false pride, and plenty of pluck and perseverance. I need not

being my first trip in your interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span> the orders were more in number
and for larger amounts. I have done my best, however, to head off some
of my competitors, and in several cases I have been successful. A few
got ahead of me in the matter of time, but I do not think they did much
business.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that the goods I offer are unsurpassed in their line,
and that the prices and terms ought to call forth an instant and
generous response on the part of the trade. But times are dull and
business men, just now, seem to be over-cautious.</p>

<p>They seem perfectly satisfied with our goods, prices and terms, but
they are, nevertheless, terribly afraid of overstocking themselves. Any
number of promises are made to order in a short time&mdash;but we all know
what these promises amount to. In spite of all, I am impressed with the
hopeful spirit that prevails. There is a general feeling that better
times are in sight. When confidence is fully restored, I have no doubt
we shall have a splendid trade.</p>

<p>Kindly keep me posted on any novelties you may have on hand.</p>

to that date a case of books we shipped them over your line on the

inconvenience to our customers, and we earnestly hope that the case
will be traced by telegraph and that you may be able, within the next
few hours, to notify us that it has finally reached its destination.</p>

that the case of books marked "S. C." was delivered this a.m. to
Messrs. Stonington &amp; Co., of P&mdash;&mdash;. The cause of delay was due to the
misdirection of a car, which it took us about four days to trace up.

find me just the thing I want. After fourteen years of exhausting

break loose entirely from my present engagements, and either take
an extensive tour of travel, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>or enter on some light and pleasant
occupation that would serve to interest me without involving any
anxious care. In short, it is suggested that two years on a farm would
secure me a new lease of life. I think I have presented my case pretty
clearly. Country life, in a locality where I need not be far from home
and friends, attracts me more than does the traveling.</p>

<h4><b>95. Asking a Friend to Make a Purchase for the Writer.</b></h4>

<p class="right">T&mdash;&mdash;, April 21, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear Miss Clancy:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">Will it impose too much upon your kindness to ask you to attend to a
little business for me?</p>

<p>I want to buy a nice wrap, and I have no idea what people are wearing
just now. I seldom go to town, as you know, and there are no styles to
study in these parts; indeed, we are very primitive as regards dress,
and I do not like to trust entirely to fashion plates, for fear of
ordering something exaggerated.</p>

<p>Your taste is excellent, and you know so exactly what is most suitable
to my figure and height, that I should feel more than satisfied if you
would choose a coat for me at about $45, for which I enclose a check.</p>

<p>Have you been buying anything pretty this spring? I know you are a
great authority on dress, and I suppose you brought home some exquisite
gowns from Paris. Are the hats as large as ever? and what will be the
favorite color this season?</p>

<p>We are as usual very quiet down here; but I am going to pay a few
visits in the northern part of the State, next month.</p>

<p>Believe me, dear Miss Clancy, with many thanks in advance,</p>

<p><span class="marginsec">Affectionately yours,</span><br />

<h4><b>96. From a Lady Asking a Friend to Visit Furnished Houses for Rent.</b></h4>

<p class="right">P&mdash;&mdash;, January 10, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">Dear Mrs. Durant:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">We are thinking of coming to visit the city for the rest of the winter,
if we can find a small furnished house to suit us. Messrs. Roberts
&amp; Higgins, Real Estate Agents, of&mdash;&mdash; B'way, have sent me several
particulars of houses, which they highly recommend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Would you be so very kind as to go over and examine for me two houses
for which I have received visiting permits (enclosed), and tell me your
opinion of them; whether they are fairly well furnished, and thoroughly
clean&mdash;I mean as regards bedding, etc.</p>

<p>They ask a very moderate rent&mdash;$30 per week&mdash;so that I do not expect
too much in the way of furniture and carpets, and I shall be satisfied
if you could give a satisfactory report as to the general condition of
things in either of these houses.</p>

<p>It would be a real favor if you would do this for me, as I am anxious
to avoid the journey to town which personal attention to this matter
would entail.</p>

<p>Thanking you warmly in advance, and hoping that we shall see a great
deal of each other next winter,</p>

<p><span class="marginsec">Believe me, as ever,</span><br />

<h4><b>97. From a Lady to a Friend, Asking Her to Engage Rooms at the
Sea-shore.</b></h4>

<p class="right">C&mdash;&mdash;, June 15, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">Dear Mrs. Johnson:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">We have almost decided to spend two months at Long Branch, and I should
much prefer taking furnished apartments to going to a hotel. I thought
perhaps you might be able to recommend us some rooms where we should
be comfortable. If not, would you mind the trouble of making a few
inquiries?</p>

<p>We should like to face the sea if possible, and require a sitting-room
and three bed-rooms, with private bath. I suppose the rent would be
about $25 per week.</p>

<p>Should you see any rooms likely to suit, would you engage them for us
from the 1st of July for eight weeks certain? I fear the place will
be very full, and that without your help we should have no little
difficulty on our arrival in securing desirable accommodation.</p>

<p>I hope we shall have fine weather during our stay at the sea-shore, and
see a great deal of you all.</p>

<p>With our united kind regards, believe me,</p>

that the money would be forthcoming at the time agreed upon, and that I
should hear nothing more regarding it. I yesterday received notice from
a Mr. Wilson, whom I do not know, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>that the note has been presented at

you had no right to deceive me in this way.</p>

me with that sum for a couple of months, when I shall refund the amount

leaving an old friend in a hole, and I beg you to accept the loan of

<p class="right">P&mdash;&mdash;, December 10, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear Bess:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">I am in great financial trouble at the present moment, being
unexpectedly called upon to pay a heavy bill of costs to my lawyers,
which they demand in a rather threatening manner. You know that I
recently lost an important suit which I found among the assets (?) of
my poor Harry. The bill amounts to $357, and they ask for this amount
within ten days. I am unable to meet this heavy sum just now, and I
write to ask if you would be so very kind as to lend me $125.</p>

<p>You may depend upon my repaying you as soon as my late husband's
affairs are straightened out; although, I must say, the resources
left me, after all just debts shall have been settled, will be
possibly inadequate to meet my many expenses, which renders this, may
I say extortionate, demand the harder to submit to; but in the hands
of lawyers one feels helpless and powerless. At least this is my
experience of the profession.</p>

<p>I do trust you may be able to grant my request. I shall be sincerely
grateful to you for any assistance you can give me.</p>

<p class="margin"><span class="smcap">Dear Madam:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in15">I have had charge for four years of the millinery department in one of
the largest dry goods establishments in this city. During that period
it has never seemed convenient for me to take a vacation. The time has
at last come when I must seek full relaxation; although not an invalid,
I am dreadfully run down. The doctor prescribes immediate and thorough
rest. He says I do not require medicine, but a month in a quiet home,
where I shall have pure air, plain food and no worry. Miss Etheridge,
who is a friend of mine, and was a neighbor of yours until she came to
S&mdash;&mdash;, says the Uplands Farm is the very place for me, and that you
are just the kindly friend I need to make a month of peace and quiet
a season of perfect delight. I write, therefore, to ask if you could
find room for me in your hospitable home, and on what terms. I promise
to give you little trouble, for I am not an invalid, nor am I given to
"fine city ways," or full of foolish fancies. I want perfect freedom
from care and worry; to sleep, to read, to ramble in the woods and
meadows; anything to give my poor, tired mind and body four weeks of
unbroken rest. Miss Etheridge will write by this mail, and I shall be
glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience, as I should like to
begin my vacation about June 17.</p>

been drawing a little upon her imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
We are a very plain sort of people at the Uplands Farm, as she knows
right well. Still, if simple living, fresh air, and perfect rest is
what you require, I think we can accommodate you. B&mdash;&mdash; Lake is within
walking distance, and the whole neighborhood is very beautiful. If
$&mdash;&mdash; for the month's board meets your views, I think I could undertake
to entertain you, with the hope of providing what you desire.</p>

<p class="in15">My little girl, Mary, who is just 11 years old, has been growing much
too fast for her health. The doctor says there is nothing at all the
matter with her, and that she has a splendid constitution, but thinks
a little special attention just now would be of great advantage to her
through life, and he, therefore, suggests that she spend the coming
summer at a farm house, where she would have the benefit of a simple
fare and of living almost entirely in the open air.</p>

<p>Mary is not an invalid, nor even in delicate health. If you could make
it convenient to board her for the summer, I should esteem it a great
favor. You are not very far from D&mdash;&mdash;, so Mary could occasionally
visit her home and some of us could come out and visit her; in that way
she would not probably be troubled with homesickness. She is a good,
obedient child, and would give you little trouble. I shall be glad to
hear from you at your earliest convenience.</p>

<p class="in10">Your letter of the 17th to hand. I think I could make room for your
daughter during the summer if, as your letter indicates, she would
be perfectly content with plain living and the simple comforts of a
farmhouse. I find my second daughter, Sophia, is already acquainted
with your little girl, having met her on two or three occasions at
D&mdash;&mdash; during the Christmas holidays of last year. This would make it
pleasant for both children.</p>

<p class="noin">Dear Mrs. Beamans:&mdash;</p>

<p>Will you allow me to ask you a few questions respecting a school kept
by the Misses Primley. I understand your little girl is one of their
pupils. Are you thoroughly satisfied with the system of education
followed at this school, and are the domestic arrangements with regard
to comfort and living all that you could wish? My little girl is rather
delicate, and requires care. Do you think she would be happy in the
Misses Primley's charge, and is your daughter likely to remain with
them beyond this term? I should feel grateful for any confidential
particulars you could give me on this to me most important subject, and
hope you will kindly excuse my troubling you with these inquiries.</p>

<p class="noin">Dear Mrs. Carrlyon:&mdash; </p>

<p>You ask if my daughter is to remain at S&mdash;&mdash; beyond this term. I am
seriously thinking of having her home at once, as she has not been
at all well lately, and I doubt if the confinement of school hours
altogether agrees with her. I can hardly express an opinion with
respect to the progress she has made in her studies, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>as she has been
there so short a time. I believe the living is fairly good, but, as you
know, delicate children require especial care and attention. The Misses
Primley's school was not personally recommended to me by any friend of
mine; it came to my notice simply through an advertisement. I shall be

<p>The nineteenth century is the grandest of all the centuries of time.
It has done more for the education, the culture and the comfort of the
world than all the ages that have gone before. Schools, seminaries and
colleges have increased to an almost fabulous extent. With the increase
in numbers there has been also an increase in efficiency and influence
to such an extent that our institutions of education have become the
glory of our land. In the eventful years of this century science has
marched on with majestic strides, revealing to the earnest student the
long-kept secrets of nature; while the spirit of invention has been
busy through all the years making the path of life easier to walk,
and redeeming our common life from much of its hardship and drudgery.
The railway, the steamship, the telegraph and the telephone are hard
at work bridging over space, and making minutes sufficient for tasks
that not long ago required months to perform. The printing press is
regarded by common consent as one of the greatest inventions the world
has ever seen. It has been <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>described not inaptly as the miracle of the
fifteenth century. But within the last few years the typewriter has
come to claim a share in its honors, and to take its place among the
most wonderful contrivances of the age.</p>

<p>It would seem as though letter-writing, which half a century ago was
a luxury and a delight, is about to become a lost art, a mere memory
of days of happy leisure. Before the advent of Sir Rowland Hill, and
the establishment of that wonder of our civilization, the modernized
post office, men and women of education occupied their leisure hours in
writing long, delightful letters to their friends.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that much of the most admirable literature
of the eighteenth century took the form of letters. The best critics
and essayists of that time, such men as Addison, and Steele, and Pope
were aptly described as "men of letters." The severest and most caustic
political strictures ever written were "The Letters of Junius," though
who "Junius" was remains a secret, and will probably remain so to the
end of time.</p>

<p>But the world moves on! The days of leisure are passed, and a
busier age demands quicker methods. In answer to this demand the
writing-machines have appeared. These marvelous labor-saving inventions
have already wrought a revolution in our commercial life, and they
bid fair to put an end to letter-writing in all branches of commerce
and in clerical professions generally. Yet, as long as the world
lasts letter writing will hold an important place; indeed, it will
always be a part of our best life. Business even will sometimes assume
such importance, and involve so many intricate details, that it will
seem that nothing short of a long and carefully written letter, in
which the individuality of the writer appears in the character of his
hand-writing, will fully serve the purpose of the occasion.</p>

<p>There is something formal and official inseparable from a type-written
letter. Type-written letters are more or less all alike, they have no
individuality, are marked by no personal characteristics; while, on the
other hand, no two letters from the pens of different writers are ever
alike. A firm may send a dozen type-written letters on some important
subject, with little or no result. But if the head of some department,
or better still, the head of the firm himself, with his own hand, write
a letter, then the matter is sure to receive prompt attention. Indeed,
any matter <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>of more than ordinary importance is surely well worth the
trouble of a written letter.</p>

<p>In more intimate intercourse, the hand-written letter still reigns
supreme. The mother does not want a machine-written letter from her
son. Type-written letters might be from some other son to some other
mother. She wants to see her son's hand-writing, for to her loving
eyes, his angular, awkward, and even misspelt, letters are a thousand
times more beautiful and symmetrical than any letter any typewriter
ever produced. What ardent lover would care to receive a type-written
letter? Do not lovers fondly linger, and dote, and dream over the very
characters wrought by the hand they love so well? A letter from a
lover's hand is a revelation that no machine-written letter can ever
be. Besides all this, are there not dottings of i's and crossings of
t's, and countless twists, and turns, and underlinings, all full to the
brim of mystic meanings that no typewriter on earth could convey?</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_090.jpg" width="602" height="400" alt="illustration" />
</div>

<p>There are other things, moreover, that it would show very poor taste to
commit to the typewriter. Such, for example, as letters of condolence
or congratulation. No thoughtful, cultured person would send a letter
of condolence to a mother who had lost a child, or a letter of
congratulation on a wedding anniversary, written on a machine! It would
be as far from good taste as though sent from a printing office in
printed form.</p>

<p>Who would have cared to have received type-written letters from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
brave boys who were fighting the battles of freedom thirty years ago?
What treasures those letters were! Written from the battle-fields,
on scraps of paper, with the drum head for a desk. Written in haste
while "the foe was suddenly firing"; crumpled, blotted, and sometimes
stained with blood. How the mothers and sweethearts kissed the
precious missives, and even sturdy fathers were not ashamed of tears!
The straggling, imperfect penmanship was beautiful, seen by the eyes
of love. While love and tenderness endure, love letters and letters
sent home must be written by the hand, for there is often as much
impressiveness in the form of a letter as in the accents of the voice.
In short, good and careful letter-writing will always form an important
element in a liberal education. A gentleman is nowhere so much a
gentleman as in his letters.</p>

<p>It would be a good thing for Young America to take to heart the thought
that the debts of personal correspondence are very sacred obligations.
It is a cheap and easy thing to say that the friendship that cannot
last without periodical letters had better die; but if friendship is
worth having, if friendship is more than a name, it is surely worth
keeping and guarding, when all that is asked to keep the fires upon
its altars aflame is an occasional kindly letter. Thoughtlessness in
this direction is unkindness, and especially in the matter of letters
for the home circle. The "exile from home," in far-away lands, finds
a letter from home as cheering and refreshing as a fountain in a dry
desert land. And in like manner, the home-circle, and especially the
mother's heart, is made strong and glad, and goes comforted for many a
day by a kindly letter, however brief, from the absent and the loved.</p>

<h4><b>116. To a Son Entering Business.</b></h4>

<p class="right">L&mdash;&mdash;, April 27, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear George:&mdash;</p>

<p>The fact that your school days are ended and that you are about to
enter on the real business of life, is a matter of deep interest to me,
as well as of great importance to yourself. I am not disposed to preach
a sermon to you, but a few words of good advice will not come amiss
just now. All I want to say to-day I can compress into three very brief
sentences. Be truthful. Be honest. Be manly. The man who is truthful in
spirit as well as in letter, who is so thoroughly honest that he will
neither steal nor take an unfair advantage, who is upright and manly in
all his dealings, is the man who, in the long run, wins competence and
honor. Let the Golden Rule be a guide for you through life. A sentiment
from Shakespeare may fitly close this brief letter:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><div class="i0">"To thine own self be true;</div>
<div class="i0">And it must follow as the night the day,</div>

<p class="center">H&mdash;&mdash; College,</p>
<p class="right">H&mdash;&mdash;, February 2, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">Dear Father:&mdash;</p>

<p>You had told me enough of your affairs during my visit at home to
prepare me somewhat for the news contained in your last letter. I
hope even yet that means may be found by which you can meet your
obligations. I shall be proud if I can be of any service to you at
this critical time, but whether I can or not, I shall not be satisfied
unless I make the effort. I want your <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>approval in what I propose. You
have, with much sacrifice I know, given me a year and a half of college
life. I can never tell how much it has meant to me. Whatever I may
be able to do for you now will not repay the debt of gratitude I owe
you. The semi-annual examinations are just over, so that now is a very
convenient time to break off here. I want to go straight to work. With
energy and perseverance I can find something to do. Please write me at
once that you consent, and give me any advice that occurs to you. I
would suggest that I go to Uncle Henry's in C&mdash;&mdash;, and keep his books
evenings for my board, as he proposed last fall. I know of nothing
new in his circumstances that would have caused him to change his
mind about wanting me. I have written to him, and I look for a reply
to-morrow morning. If he is willing to take me, and you think well of
the plan, there will be nothing to prevent my going at once. In a city
like C&mdash;&mdash;, there must be plenty of employment for a willing, active
young man, of fair ability and education, and good principles. What
I may be able to earn will perhaps help you a little in your present
difficulty; please, dear father, accept this offer from</p>

<h4><b>118. Answer to the Above.</b></h4>

<p class="noin">My Dear Boy:&mdash;</p>

<p>The generous spirit of your letter brought the tears to my eyes. I
know well how much it will cost you to give up, or even postpone your
college course. It will be hard to break off class associations, and
leave the work that you find so congenial. I wish I could thank you
for your noble offer, and tell you that we could worry through without
your help, but I find, that my affairs are in a worse condition than
intimated in my last letter. Have not given up hope yet, still cannot
conscientiously refuse any means of relief that comes to me. Go, my
dear son, to your Uncle Henry's, and God bless you. Am well-nigh
crushed by this trouble, but the thought of your manly attitude brings
me comfort and support. With God's help we shall pull through.</p>

<b>119. To a Mother from Her Daughter after First Day in College.</b></h4>

<p class="center">R&mdash;&mdash; College,</p>
<p class="right">R&mdash;&mdash;, September 20, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">Dear Mother:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">You have probably received by this time the postal card that I wrote
you while we were in the midst of unpacking. We have at last emerged
from chaos. I wish you could see our room&mdash;it is so cosy and inviting.</p>

<p>I have so many things to tell you that I hardly know where to begin.
"At the beginning," you will say. Very well. There was a gay crowd of
laughing, excited girls at the station when I arrived. Such kissing
and little shrieks and hugs! I felt quite left out in the cold. We all
piled into the college bus together. It was a drive of two miles to the
college buildings, and the scenery along the way was perfectly lovely.
After we had arrived I was standing quite forsaken in the great main
hall watching people who seemed entirely at home pass back and forth or
gather in little knots, when a girl came up to me and said: "You are a
new girl, are you not? If you will tell me your name I will show you
to your room." Have since found out that the sophomores have charge
of looking after the freshmen, and this girl was a sophomore. When
she learned my name she went to the office to consult the directory,
and came back and took me to room 89, on the third floor. There was
a large bunch of daisies in a vase on the table. When I admired it,
she said, "That's the way we sophomores have of hazing the freshmen."
We had a long conversation, and she told me a great many things about
the college and what to expect, and finally she concluded, "Now, don't
forget, Miss Clarke, that I found you, and you sort of belong to me.
If, at any time, you desire any wise advice, or if you get into any
scrape and want to get out cleverly, why, call upon me. My name is Alma
Robertson, address No. 56, east corridor, 2d floor. You know you can't
do much till you've seen Prexy, so you'd better get your number as soon
as you can."</p>

<p>I discovered before long what she meant. There were about ten girls
waiting in the outer office of the President. Some one handed me a
square of paper marked 53. "No. 17 is closeted now," a girl told
me, "and I am No. 18." So I went back to my room to wait&mdash;no longer
<i>my</i> room, however, but <i>our</i> room, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>for there I found my room mate.
She is perfectly lovely. Her name is Elizabeth Gyllane. She is a
sophomore, and the friend from her own class whom she expected to room
with her had not returned to college. I know Elizabeth was very much
disappointed, but she made me feel at once that she was pleased with
the arrangement made for her, and she was as sweet as could be to me.
She is one of the most tactful and unselfish persons I ever met. She is
from Virginia, and speaks with a southern accent. She has no mother. Do
you think that is why she likes so much to hear about my own? She says
she has a very clear impression of you already, and almost loves you.
I never got acquainted with any one so quickly before. She understands
exactly what you mean and how you feel, and you don't have to explain
things.</p>

<p>Every girl has to take an hour's exercise a day. You can walk or you
are allowed to row in the wide flat-bottomed boats, if you can prove to
the authorities that one is not strong enough to capsize them.</p>

<p>We have not had regular recitations yet, but our lessons are all
assigned for to-morrow. I had no idea I should dread it as I do. All
the girls I have met have such a superior, learned air&mdash;not at all like
the high-school girls. I have a perfect horror of being considered
stupid.</p>

<p>Elizabeth and I are going for a row at 3 o'clock this afternoon. She
has a great many friends who are always coming to see her and making
plans that include her, but she told me this morning that she wanted me
to go out with her this afternoon&mdash;"just we two alone," she said, "for
a nice long time together."</p>

<p>I don't know what I should do without her. Last evening I felt so
lonely and homesick. I was thinking of you and papa and the baby,
and how long it would be before I should see my beloved ones again.
Elizabeth found me in our bedroom on the bed, and she was just
splendid. She didn't try to jolly me up, but instead she was very
serious, and talked with me about my home. She put her arm about me and
said, "Alice, your kind of homesickness is a blessed thing. One may be
homesick because one has no home to be homesick for." I wondered if
she meant herself, but I didn't say anything, for fear of making her
feel badly. But I thought how very selfish I was to be accepting her
sympathy when perhaps she needed sympathy more than I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Please give my dearest love to papa, and ask baby not to forget "Lala."</p>

<p>I am sure I am going to be very happy here, dear mother, although the
homesick feeling takes possession of me every once in a while. It seems
already as if I had not seen you for half a year.</p>

<p>You must have been very tired after I left home, you had worked so hard
helping me get ready. I find I have everything I need, and my clothes
look beautifully. I can never thank you enough for all you have done
for me, and are doing for me. I know you will say that the best thanks
I can offer is to make the most of my opportunities, and I shall try
not to disappoint you.</p>

<h4><b>120. Answer to the Above.</b></h4>

<p class="right">B&mdash;&mdash;, September 23, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p>Dear Mabel:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">Your long, interesting letter was duly received. We are very glad to
have a clear idea of your new life, and to know that everything opens
up so pleasantly. Elizabeth seems to be a very lovely girl, of fine
sensibility and womanly character, and I hope sometime we may all know
her. She is evidently trying to make your first few days of college
life happy ones, and in order to reciprocate her unselfish thought
for you, you must have your eyes open to see her needs and wishes. I
have regretted that you had no sister of your own age to share your
room with you at home, for experience teaches one many lessons in the
art of being an ideal room-mate&mdash;for it is an art. Perfect breeding,
delicacy of perception that will keep one from ever being intrusive,
adaptability in little things, orderly habits, responsiveness,
sympathy, unselfishness, loyalty, are the qualities to be cultivated by
one who desires to be at all times an entirely agreeable room-mate, and
these you have, my child, all in more or less degree, I believe: but
you are apt to be thoughtless, and you will need to exercise care and
self-control. I believe that the friendships you form at college with
your classmates and teachers are as important as the studies you are
pursuing. This does not imply that you should ever neglect your lessons
for social enjoyment. I am sure you have too much good sense to draw
such a conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Your father and I are very anxious that you should derive much culture
and good mental training from your college course. As far as you can
command your own motives, study for the knowledge and the discipline to
be derived, rather than for marks or class standing. The higher one's
aim, the more permanent will be the result.</p>

<p>It is hard to become used to your being away, my precious child. The
house is lonely without you. But it is for your good, and I am so
thankful that we can give you this opportunity that I do not grumble.
It is a comfort to us to be able to remember that you have always been
a good daughter. We love to recall your pleasant ways, and the many
proofs of your earnest purpose to do right.</p>

<p>Write to us freely, and tell us of your successes and your
difficulties, for we shall want to know all that concerns you.</p>

<p>Gertrude has been to the house to inquire what we have heard from you.
She will be delighted to have you write to her. You must not forget
your old friends in making new ones. Aunt Mary, also, will appreciate a
nice letter from you.</p>

<p>The baby wanted to write "Bebel," so I gave her paper and pencil, and
she insists upon my enclosing her scrawl. Good-bye, my darling. God
bless you. Father says: "Tell Mabel I love her."</p>

<p class="in10">I have planned that this letter should reach you on the morning of
the 27th, which is your sixteenth birthday. Your father, brothers and
sisters desire me to speak for them, and to say how sincerely we send
you a thousand good wishes on this happy day. If only you could have
been at home with us, that we might have had one of those old-time
festivals! But, dear daughter, the path of duty demands many sacrifices
of us all. You are where it is best for you to be, fitting yourself for
the serious but delightful duties that must sooner or later demand your
attention.</p>

<p>A little box, which I hope has reached you safely, contains some
trifling tokens of affection from each one of us, which I know you
will appreciate to the full. The box also contains the materials for a
pleasant little entertainment, which, I have no doubt, Mrs. Dash will
allow you to give to your school-fellows, as I have written to beg a

but am quite sure I shall never get on in this kind of occupation.</p>

<h4><b>133. From a Mother-in-Law to a Son-in-Law.</b></h4>

<p class="right">D&mdash;&mdash;, November 12, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear Alfred:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">I was delighted to hear such an excellent account of you all from
Alice; although it is some time since I have been to your house, still
I must always feel deeply interested in all that concerns you and yours.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was too hasty in concluding that the advice I offered would
offend you: I know, it is generally considered that a mother-in-law's
interference is never welcome, however reasonable may be her remarks;
but, believe me, dear Alfred, what I said was meant in good faith,
and I had no intention of censuring or criticising any arrangement of
yours. I should have expressed the same opinion to any friend of mine
under similar circumstances had I been consulted. The fact of your
being my son-in-law induced me to imagine that I might speak frankly to
you without fear of giving offence; indeed, I regard you as a son, and
you must not be too quick to resent words my motherly affection prompts
me to say.</p>

<p>With kindest love to Alice, yourself and my dear little grandchildren,</p>

<p class="right">P&mdash;&mdash;, December 30, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear Maud:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">I have to tell you how much I enjoyed my little visit last week, the
first I have paid to your pretty new home, and I trust many years of
happiness are in store for you and my dear <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>son. He tells me that he
has in you the most considerate and affectionate of wives: I sincerely
rejoice that it is so. I have seen so many unhappy marriages, rendered
such through thoughtlessness and extravagance on the part of the wife,
that nothing pleases me more than to think my boy is so fortunate
in his choice. His limited means call for the most careful domestic
management, and not a little self-denial, and it is so easy when first
commencing housekeeping to run into more expense than one's income
justifies; but this error I am sure you will carefully guard against,
always remembering what strict supervision is required in the smallest
domestic details.</p>

<p>I have learned this from experience, dear Maud, which I have found to
be the best, if not the most pleasant, of teachers.</p>

and how you have enjoyed your stay in the mountains. We received your
last letter dated July 31st, and have been a little surprised at not
hearing from you oftener.</p>

<p>I hardly know where to write to you, but suppose this letter will
follow you at the Summit House. Edward is pretty well, and is looking
forward to his vacation, which has been postponed this year on account
of extra work in the office, but we do not regret this, as we have had

<p class="in10">We have been delighted to learn from your last letter that you
have been quite well in spite of the severe weather we have lately
experienced, and that you are in such good spirits. How wise not to let
the small worries of life depress you. I wish I had a little of your
philosophy; as it is, I take things too much to heart, and am inclined
to allow trifles to vex me. You set us all such a good example by your
unvaried cheerfulness.</p>

<p>I suppose you were very much interested in Tuesday's meeting, as you
are such a keen judge of politics; but will not express my opinion of
it, gathered second-hand from my husband, in case it should run counter

<p class="noin">My Dear Julius:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">As you doubtless know, from long personal experience, my husband is a
very bad correspondent, and has, I have discovered, allowed your last
kind letter to remain unanswered for nearly a month; so I will try and
take his place as far as possible, and ask you to accept me as his
substitute. Your news was most interesting to us both. You seem to have
had a very pleasant holiday; we quite envied you, and I very much wish
Horace could have gone along, if only for a week; but he is so hard
worked that there seems no chance of his having even a day's holiday
until the end of the season. He is, however, am happy to say, quite
well. I suppose you will be back about the end of the month; if my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
advice is worth having, I should say do not make the long and fatiguing
return journey too quickly, but take a fair amount of rest on the way;
it is a great mistake to travel night and day after weeks of complete
repose and quiet, and is calculated to destroy most of the benefit
derived from change of climate and surroundings.</p>

<p class="noin">Dear Polly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">You have doubtless asked yourself why I did not write to you lately;
the fact is, I have been rather out of spirits, besides being very much
occupied.</p>

<p>Am beginning to discover there is little chance of promotion where I am
now employed, and that it is almost time to look around for something
better. Do you think your husband might take any active interest in me,
and would you dislike speaking to him on the subject? I do not exactly
know the extent of his influence, or indeed if he possesses any, but
I thought from the responsible position he holds with Lombard Bros. &amp;
Co., he might perhaps know of some opening that would suit me. I have
never as yet spoken to him about my own affairs, and if, on your part,
you feel any reluctance in mentioning the subject, pray do not hesitate
to tell me so.</p>

<p class="in10">I have an important favor to ask, which I trust you will grant, if it
can be done without any real inconvenience.</p>

<p>I have just received a very pressing invitation to go with Mrs. Hubbard
and her daughters to London and Paris; afterward to make a tour with
them in Switzerland. This would be quite a new experience for me,
as I have never yet been abroad. I could not, of course, promise to
join them until I had consulted with you about it, dear Ned, and ask
you whether you would make me a small advance to meet the necessary
expenses of the journey, and to purchase the few things I should
require before starting.</p>

<p>Would you think $300 too much to spare at the present time? I have
a little money left, but not enough to justify my accepting this
invitation without some little help. You have always been so kind and
considerate toward us all, younger children, that I know you will
gladly give me this pleasure if it lies in your power to do so. It
seems a long time since I have seen you, or even heard from you, but
I know how many your engagements are, and that a letter from one so
busy is hardly to be expected, unless there is something especially
interesting to be communicated.</p>

<p class="in10">I do earnestly hope you and Uncle Phillip have not thought me
neglectful in not writing to you before this, but beyond asking after
you both and hoping you are quite well, I felt I had nothing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>to write
about. I lead, as you know, such a quiet life, and the days so resemble
each other, that I can hardly distinguish them apart. I ought perhaps
to be glad of this, as family news when it has to be told is seldom a
matter of rejoicing; quite the contrary, it generally forebodes trouble
and sorrow&mdash;at least I have found it so.</p>

<p>The east winds have been very trying to my mother lately, but I am
happy to say she is fairly well and able to go out every day. She sends
her love to you, and hopes to have the pleasure of seeing you and my
dear uncle before long.</p>

<p>How is your work society getting on? I suppose your Sunday-school

Uncle Phillip must be just now in his garden. Are the bees thriving?

returning Christmastide, I fear we should almost drop out of each
other's recollection. I am therefore glad of the opportunity of
inquiring after you and Aunt Mary, and trust that you are both

<p>I dislike extremely to refuse a request of yours, but were I to comply
with the last one, just received, I should only encourage you in
extravagance. Your poor father considered the sum at present allowed
you amply sufficient for your wants, and I do not feel justified in
acting contrary to his expressed wishes. However, I have no objection
to making you a present of $100 to meet any pressing claim, but must
again warn you that it is imperative you should restrict expenses
within the limits of your allowance, and this can readily be done
by giving a little more attention to details, and by being less

I may say that I have been well educated, and am quite capable of
instructing young ladies up to the age of fourteen. Mrs. Campbell has

a letter I just received from this young lady, that she has not
hitherto filled a similar situation, but this I should not consider
a drawback if her qualifications were satisfactory. Would you say
she was thoroughly well educated? Can she teach French and German to
beginners, and has she a good knowledge of music? Is she both amiable
and conscientious? She says you have known her family for some years,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
so no doubt will be able to satisfy me on all these points. As regards

you kindly mention this to her, and if your answer is such as I expect,
I shall have no hesitation in engaging her at once. I have had a great

obliging, and in all respects a good servant, also the reason of her
leaving Mrs. White's service?</p>

<p>Mrs. White begs to say that Eliza Smith is honest and steady, but
would require no little training before she could be considered a good
servant. She was only in her service a very short time, and Mrs. White
parted with her, as she was not equal to the work.</p>

<p class="noin">Dear Miss O'Neil:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">For some time past, I have been anxious to make my feelings known to
you, but have not had an opportunity of doing so. I therefore think it
best not to delay any longer, but to tell you by letter that I very
much wish to make you my wife, if you think you could be happy with me.
We have seen each other so often the last two years, I am quite sure
I should never like any one but you; and want you to express the same
favorable opinion about me, and say that your heart is mine, my dear
Mary. If this is so, the sooner we are married the better.</p>

<p>The legacy of $600 received from my late master, added to my own
savings of the last ten years, will enable me to take a boarding-house
in a good location, and have already seen one which no doubt would
answer very well; but I cannot decide upon anything until you accept me
as your husband, and if I have not greatly mistaken your sentiments I
believe you will.</p>

<p class="in10">I answer your kind and welcome letter at once. You have not mistaken my
feelings: I have a great respect and esteem for you joined to a sincere
affection, and from what I know of you, I feel sure you would make me
a good and kind husband, and therefore have no hesitation in accepting
your offer. Am very much flattered by your good opinion of me, and, as
your wife, I will do everything in my power to continue to deserve it.</p>

<p>I hardly know what to say about being married at once, as I am very
comfortable in my present situation, and putting by a little money
every year; but, as you think of taking a boarding-house at once, I had
better hear what you have to say before making up my mind either way.</p>

<h4><b>163. From a Gentleman to a Young Lady Friend of His about a
Misunderstanding.</b></h4>

<p class="right">D&mdash;&mdash;, September 5, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear Miss Reiley:&mdash;</p>

<p>Will you, please, pardon my addressing this note to you? I write not
from a dislike of a personal interview, but because it is better to
avoid any unnecessary embarrassment for either of us. I scarcely think
it is due to over-sensitiveness on my part that you have seemed of
late to repel me. Had I not previously been made gratefully happy by
your frank cordiality toward me, I should unquestionably accept your
present manner as indicative of your wishes in regard to me. But as it
is, I don't understand you, and I am sure you don't understand me. If
I have offended you in any way, it has been unknowingly, and it would
be a privilege to be allowed to explain myself, or apologize if needed.
With this in view, will you give me the pleasure of your company for a
drive Saturday afternoon at four o'clock? If it is a matter of perfect
indifference, I beg of you to make no excuses in consideration of my
feelings in declining this invitation.</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear Mr. Duncan:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have not meant to be mysterious. If any inconsistency in my manner
toward you has disturbed your mind, it is for me <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>to ask your pardon.
It has been quite unintentional. I will be much pleased to drive with
you, as suggested, Saturday afternoon, when any further explanations
that may be necessary can be exchanged.</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear Mr. Duncan:&mdash;</p>

<p>It will give me pleasure to drive with you, as suggested, Saturday
afternoon. You must not think it is a matter of indifference to me if I
have treated you with injustice, and I want to do my part in coming to
a satisfactory understanding. Perhaps an exchange of explanations will
set everything right.</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear Mr. Duncan:&mdash;</p>

<p>I think that my manner toward my friends and acquaintances usually
represents me correctly. Truth to one's self will not always allow
absolute uniformity in one's outward action. This, I trust, will
sufficiently account for any change you may have noticed in my attitude
toward you. I think a further exchange of explanations will not be
profitable.</p>

happened at home during my absence, and I will not repeat myself to you.</p>

<p>I was disappointed yesterday, but this evening your letter came&mdash;and
what a welcome it received! I cannot tell you how much a part of my
life your letters have become, how they have helped to lift me to a
purer, clearer atmosphere, how they have made the common things of
everyday seem noble and worth while. Should our friendship end here, I
could not but be deeply grateful for what you have done for me&mdash;done
unconsciously by simply being what you are&mdash;and all my life I should
be a better man for having met you. At the very beginning of our
acquaintance you won my heart by your gentle ways and your bright,
sweet unselfishness and ready sympathy, and time has only deepened the
feeling that was awakened in me by my first meeting with you. It has
been hard, harder than you can ever know, my darling, to love as I
have loved you and be silent so long. You are the most beautiful, the
dearest girl in all the world, and I love you, love you with all my
heart and strength and soul, and long to prove it by a life's devotion.
Dearest, all that I have or am or ever hope to be is yours, yours now
and forever, yours wholly and absolutely. Would I had more to offer
you! It is little&mdash;only myself. Dear Eleanor, can it not be? May I not
devote my life to making you happy and myself more worthy of you? If
you are not sure of yourself, only give me a chance and I will make you
love me. Let me plead my cause in person. I long to see your own sweet

Your beauty has
inspired me with a most sincere admiration, and the various occasions
on which I have had the pleasure of seeing you have served but to
deepen the impression at first created; thus the one hope that animates
me in writing, is that you may be induced to return my affection and
ultimately become my wife. My position and means would, probably, be
found satisfactory to your friends, and I trust you will give me an
early opportunity of pleading my suit in person, and of offering every
possible explanation to your relatives respecting my prospects in
life. In the meantime, I should tell you that I have lately become a
junior partner in the well-known firm of Messrs. Andrews Bros. civil

question she should entertain his proposals. She need not trouble him
with her reasons for this decision, beyond saying that they are quite
conclusive, and she very much regrets, for Mr. Langdon's sake, that he
should have allowed himself to think of her for a moment. She begs to
return his photo, and to add that she trusts the impression she appears
to have made upon him will prove but a very transitory one.</p>

hope, hasten to put an end to my anxieties, and make me the happiest of
men.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you require time for consideration, do not be
afraid to ask for it. Now that you know how dearly I love you I can
afford to leave my cause in your hands, and to wait any length of time
you may consider necessary for your final decision.</p>

attentions I had the happiness of paying you; but lest any doubt should
exist in your mind as to the strength of my attachment, let me tell
you how very dear you are to me, and how each time I have seen you the
feeling has deepened into more devoted love.</p>

<p>I feel sure that I am not indifferent to you, and that were it
otherwise, you are too kindhearted to have misled me into believing
this, and therefore do not hesitate to ask for your love. May I write
to your father on this subject at once? You see, your consent is taken

assurance that I have not misunderstood your feelings, and that you
return my affection, so that before long I may have the happiness of
claiming you as my wife. How cruel that our being away from each other

<p class="noin">Dear Miss Southgate:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">For several days I have been pondering in my mind whether it would
be best to write or speak to you on the subject that is nearest to
my heart, or whether it would be wiser for your sake to keep silence
altogether; however, I have now decided to plead my cause as best I can.</p>

<p>Do you think you could be happy as the wife of a poor man? would you
be content to wait until such time as my income would justify me in
marrying? would the knowledge that my heart is all your own induce you
to feel a corresponding affection for me? or am I asking too much?
Would you be afraid to enter into a long engagement, an engagement
of perhaps two years? Although I am not in a position to maintain a
wife at the present time, my prospects are encouraging, as my uncle
has promised to take me into partnership early next year, which will
materially improve my position. In the meantime, the knowledge that I
am working for you will brighten every hour of my life, while for your
goodness in thus waiting and trusting, no after-devotion on my part can
ever repay.</p>

<p>I hope your answer will not be long delayed, as my anxiety will be
great, indeed.</p>

<p class="noin">Dear Mr. Redfield:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">It would not be truthful for me to say that I am surprised at the
contents of your letter; on the contrary, I almost knew beforehand
what you were anxious to say to me and what I was anxious to hear.
You cannot suppose I should be afraid to be a poor man's wife; my
love would be little worth having if it were so: no, I do not dread a
long engagement, it will give us time to know each other better; my
attachment to you is sufficiently strong to bear the strain. I am not
afraid that your feelings will undergo a change towards me, or that
mine will alter towards you. Indeed, should either of us cease to love
the other it would only prove how wise we were to put our affection to
the test by waiting.</p>

<p>My mother, I am sorry to say, entertains a prejudice against long
engagements; she has no real objection to this particular one, however,
as she has a personal liking for you, so I think she will not oppose
the realization of our wishes, as she will know that my happiness is so
deeply concerned, and together I hope we shall make her believe that
she approves of our attachment and of our engagement.</p>

<p class="in10">Believe me, I am deeply grieved at the answer I am obliged to give
you; but I have no alternative than to write as I am now doing. My
father will not for a moment hear of our engagement, and whatever my
own feelings may be, you would not, I am sure, wish me to disobey him.
He considers a long engagement would be most imprudent on our part; he

says you may not be in the same mind two years hence, and that your
prospects are too uncertain to render such a step advisable.</p>

<p>All this sounds cold and hard; but, coming from him, it must be said. I
dare not hold out a hope that, if we are both free "two years hence,"
you might expect a very different answer, because this might appear
in the light of a secret understanding; still, I do not think that I
shall easily forget you, or stop thinking of you, or cease to take a
warm interest in all that concerns you. Dear Mr. Redfield, good-bye,

<p class="in10">Lately I have had the happiness of meeting you very frequently at the
houses of mutual friends, and each occasion has served to strengthen
the impression made upon me on first seeing you. I should consider
myself the most fortunate of men if I could persuade you to accept me
as your future husband. Though well aware of the disparity of age that
exists between us, I trust that you will not regard it as a bar to my

the experience my years give me will better enable me to shield your

devoted of husbands, if you will give me the right to be so.</p>

<p>Although not a rich man by any means, still I can offer you every

<p class="in10">I deeply appreciate the honor you have done me in asking for my hand.
Although I have always entertained a great esteem and regard for you, I
had not, hitherto, thought of you as a lover; but perhaps, in time, may
feel the affection which is due from a woman to the one who is to be
her husband; only you must be content to wait a little, and not expect
too much at first. Allow me to add that my heart is quite disengaged,
and that you have no rival to contend with, merely the ideal hero who
finds a place in the imagination of most girls. My sister thinks that I
am very fortunate to have won your affections, and she hopes that you
will soon give her an opportunity of telling you so. I shall remain
here for the next three weeks, when mamma is coming up for a few days
to take me back home. I have written to her of your letter, and shall
doubtless receive an answer soon.</p>

<p class="in10">While sincerely grateful for the high compliment you pay me in asking
me to be your wife, I cannot, to my regret, entertain your proposal. I
like you very much indeed as a friend, but am quite sure I should not
be happy with one so much older than myself. You would probably think
me foolish if not frivolous, and I should very likely fear you more
than love you. In a word, I should not be a suitable wife. Please do
not think of me in that light, as it would not be for the happiness of
either of us.</p>

<p>My sister thinks otherwise, and wished me to return a very different
answer; but you are too good and kind for any one to marry you save
from motives of affection.</p>

<p class="right">S&mdash;&mdash;, July 18, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear Mrs. Lothrop:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">I have been pondering many things&mdash;reviewing the past, looking forward
to the future, and trying to see the meaning, the purpose, running
through the tangled web of life. We don't either of us believe that
chance directs our course in this world. It was not, then, chance
that brought us together at the anniversaries three years ago. Since
that time we have had many opportunities of becoming acquainted; our
children have grown to be fast friends; my boy's heart was won to you
from the first word you ever spoke to him. Chance has not worked all
this; nor is it chance, dear Mrs. Lothrop, that opened my eyes to find
in you my ideal of perfect womanhood.</p>

<p>The brief happiness that has been mine is a memory sacredly cherished
for its own sake, but the disappointments, the struggles, the sorrows
of my life have served only to prepare me to appreciate the nobility,
the sweetness and the truth of your nature, and my own need of you.
Dear Mrs. Lothrop, I love you with the deep, unchanging love of matured
manhood. I long to cherish you, to protect you and your little son from
the rude blows of the world.</p>

<p>We cannot either of us forget the past. Those whom we have loved and
who have loved us will not rejoice to see us sad and lonely for their
sake. Surely we should not wish them, in that brighter world where they
have gone, to be sad for us, and shut out other love and friendship.</p>

<p>Your boy will soon need a father, mine wants a mother now; we need each
other, and I love you with all the strength of my being. Can you not
learn to reciprocate my feelings, and if so may we not hope for God's
blessing in joining our earthly fates?</p>

<p>Much as I like and esteem you, I nevertheless shrink from the
responsibility of the position you offer me. Such a step would be
neither for your happiness nor for mine. Your daughters would very
naturally regard me as an intruder, and would feel very pained at your
marrying a girl as young as themselves. I am quite serious in what I

<p class="noin">Dear Miss Simpson:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">Ever since I have had the happiness of visiting you, on a friendly
basis, the one wish of my heart has been to become worthy of you,
and to succeed in winning your affections. I know that you have many
admirers, but none, believe me, more devoted than myself. Of course,
I have the disadvantage in the eyes of your friends of being poor and
they may endeavor to make you believe that it is the heiress I love;
but do not think so badly of me, dear Miss Simpson, as to entertain so
cruel a suspicion of one who, if you were penniless, would be proud to
prove his devotion to you. It is idle to distress you and myself with
such doubts; let me rather assure you of my unchanging love, and of
my confidence that, with youth and hope in my favor, I have a bright
career opening before me. For the fulfillment of my wishes, I should
be content to wait any time that you and your friends might consider
expedient, provided you gave me the assurance that you returned
my affection, and would lighten my probation by your sympathy and
encouragement.</p>

<p>I have but inadequately expressed what was uppermost in my heart, but
you will, I am sure, give me credit for all that was left unsaid.</p>

<p class="in10">Your letter, so tender and straightforward, made me both happy and
unhappy; happy in knowing that you love me, and unhappy at the
opposition which I fear awaits us both at the hands of my uncle and
guardian. It will be very difficult to make him believe in your
disinterested affection, and even more so to gain his consent to our
engagement; from the few words he said to me on the subject, I know he
holds very strong opinions against my marrying any one who has not some
means of his own. I need not tell you that his views are not mine in

the least; I am only too glad to be rich for your sake, but we must
both be brave, and trust in the future. You must not take umbrage at
anything my uncle may say to you, and I will endeavor to make amends
for any harshness on his part you may have to endure, by showing you
how much I value your love.</p>

<p class="in10">While I am much flattered by the favorable impression I seem to have
made upon you, I have never thought of you as a possible husband,
although as an agreeable partner at a ball I like you very much.
To speak frankly, I am certain never to care for you save as an
acquaintance. I am afraid, in spite of your disclaimer to the contrary,
that were it not for the accident of my prospective wealth you would
not have thought of proposing to me; but be this as it may, it would

MATTERS</h3>

<h4><b>204. Asking a Father for His Daughter's Hand.</b></h4>

<p class="right">N&mdash;&mdash;, February 19, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">Edward T. Jones, Esq.</p>
<p class="marginleft"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in10">I wish to write to you upon a matter in which the happiness of my
life is concerned. I have long admired your second daughter, Miss
Helen Jones, and trust I am not mistaken in thinking that she is not
indifferent to me; indeed, I am confident that, with your permission
to do so, I could succeed in winning her affections; but I hesitate to
say a word to her on this subject until assured of your sanction to
address her. I have even delayed asking for your consent to be accepted
as a suitor for your daughter's hand, fearing that you might consider
my prospects hardly justify me in taking such a step; but I can wait no
longer to declare my sentiments, and to learn what chance there may be
for me.</p>

<p>My salary and income together do not amount to more than $1,800 a year,
but with what you may be inclined to give your daughter, should her
marriage meet with your approval, I have no doubt that with prudence
and economy I might be able to make a comfortable home for her.</p>

<p>Hoping you will give this letter your favorable consideration,</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear Mr. Lloyd:&mdash;</p>

<p>I must say that I do not altogether approve of early marriages, or
think it right that a young man should rely upon other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span> than his
own resources when he contemplates maintaining a wife. However, as
my daughter's happiness is my first consideration, and as I find on
questioning her that she is evidently attached to you, I shall not
oppose your engagement, and will do what I can to enable you to marry;
but, in justice to my other children, cannot promise to do much, and
$1500 a year is the utmost allowance I can make her. Shall further
expect you both to wait at least six months, which at your time of life
ought to be and indeed is no hardship; anyway, this is the decision I
have arrived at after mature deliberation.</p>

that wherein you say you have not spoken to my daughter regarding your

allowance on her marriage. What she will receive from me at my death is
a question for my future consideration. I do not intend her to marry a
man who cannot support her without coming to her father for help, and
you will distinctly understand that I beg to decline your proposal for

<p class="margin"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in15">My frequent calls at your hospitable home during the last three months
have doubtless prepared you, to some extent at least, for the request
I am about to make. It was my good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span> fortune to meet your daughter Ada,
last Christmas eve, at the house of a mutual friend. Since that time,
many opportunities of renewing an acquaintance so pleasantly begun have
presented themselves, of which I have been delighted to avail myself.</p>

<p>The result of these happy interviews is that admiration and esteem
have ripened into love, and I now ask your kind consent to be a
suitor for your daughter's hand. I have not taken this step without
some reasonable ground for hoping that such a suit would at least be
seriously entertained. But I have been trained to regard the rights of
parents with such respect, that it would add largely to my delight in
this important step of life if I might count on your hearty consent.
You have known my family for years, and on that ground, am proud to
feel assured that there will be no difficulty whatever. My business
position and prospects are such as to assure all the joys and comforts
of a happy home, should your daughter do me the honor to share my
lot. This matter I should be glad to explain more in detail if you so
desire, and to submit a complete statement of my net assets and future
resources.</p>

<p>With sincere thanks to Mrs. Brown and yourself, and to all the members
of your household, for the many kindnesses received,</p>

<p>Your letter has not greatly surprised me. With the spirit of it I am
much pleased. Such an important step in life as you contemplate should
always be taken thoughtfully, and the hearty consent of the interested
families is, in my judgment, greatly to be desired. So far as my
daughter Ada is concerned, my one great desire for her is that her life
may be as peaceful and happy in the future as it has been in the past.
You have my consent to woo, and if wooing you should win, you will win
a treasure. I pray God will guide all for the best.</p>

I talked the matter over with my father, and he has promised to do all

will induce you to waive them, and that my dear mother will use all her

say, and what I have seen of her is quite <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>in her favor, but you must
be reminded that you are not in a position to maintain a wife; you have
your own way to make in the world, and have no right to suppose that I
can allow you sufficient income to marry upon. I should be unjust to
your brothers and sisters were I to decide otherwise; and I beg you to
understand that you have nothing to expect from me if you persist in
your imprudence, which can only be regarded as a boyish infatuation.

the fact is, your son has been paying my daughter Alice considerably
more attention than I think desirable, and a word from you would no
doubt put a stop to the matter. He has been on such a friendly footing
with my family that I did not apprehend that anything like a serious
attachment was likely to spring up between your son and either of my
daughters; however, from what I gather, such is the case.</p>

<p>I am sure you will agree with me that a marriage between my daughter
Alice and your boy would be most imprudent, if not altogether
impossible. I take for granted that he cannot look to you for an
allowance upon which to support a wife, while I am certainly not in a

mentioned so often lately in my letters to you. I was not very much

attentions. You can imagine how happy I am; he is everything one would
wish one's lover to be. I am sure you will think he is handsome. I do,
of course, and every one says he is very clever. He is five years older
than I am, which mamma thinks is an advantage. I hope you will be one
of my bridesmaids, dear Madge; we are to be married very soon. He has
taken a nice house, and you must be one of our first visitors. Papa and

know why it is, Edward, but sometimes I want to share my happiness
with everybody, and then again I like to feel that it is exclusively
my own. It is splendid of you, Edward, to be working so hard, and I am
proud, and proud that you love me. I have also been working hard since
yesterday morning. You could never guess at what. Mother and I have
been cataloguing and arranging the books in the school library; you

coming around to consult with mother about library methods, and how to
manage the circulation of the books. I am going to ask him to mail this

<p class="in10">My walk to the office this morning after papa's mail was well rewarded
by your letter. Charlie Darwin was there posting <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>eight dozens of his
circulars. He is perfectly jubilant over his prospects, and he had to
walk home with me to tell all about them. He said he was going along my
way, and if I didn't mind, as it was very slippery&mdash;Of course I said I
didn't, so I put your letter into my pocket and waited for a good time
to read it.</p>

<p>It's very funny how you wear my letters out so soon. I wonder why they
don't make note paper like the tough paper that is used in little
Paul's Baby Goose picture book.</p>

<p>I had a fine time at our Church Fair last night. Mrs. Sullivan changed
her mind at the last, and had me serve as Rebecca at the Well, while
Maggie presided at the candy booth, just as she had wanted to. Guess
how many glasses of lemonade I sold. One hundred and seventeen. Charlie
Darwin drank eight. Do you think you could have swallowed as many as
that, Alfred?</p>

<p>I am keeping up my practicing pretty well, that is, I practice an
hour a day, except the days I write to you. Would you rather have me
practice <i>every</i> day? You know, I am keeping up my piano only because
you are so anxious to have me, and I want you to be satisfied. People
think I am getting on very nicely.</p>

<p>The sleigh ride was grand. All the girls went, and nearly all the boys.
Phillip Small could not get permission to go. It was a perfect shame.
Every one missed him. We had a fine supper at the Davidsons' old place.</p>

<p>Oh, Alfred, I wish you could come home for Christmas. It will be so
lonely and dismal for you, away off by yourself, and it won't seem at
all like Christmas here without you. How I long to see you! There is so
much to tell. Do you remember last Christmas, dearest? Mamma is trying
to send me to bed, so I must stop writing. But I haven't answered all
your questions. Oh, Al. dear, are you never satisfied? What do you
suppose Charlie said to me this morning? "Daisy, you're all heart&mdash;just
one big heart." Doesn't that sound like him? And there wasn't anything
to lead up to it. I was weighed last Wednesday at the butcher's. Guess
how much? 122 pounds. There, mamma is calling. Good night, Al. But I
was going to answer your question how much I love you. If Charlie and
the scales spoke the truth I think about 122 pounds. But then, Charlie
was only joking. He doesn't mean half he says. Do you think so?</p>

short period in which to learn the tastes, feelings, and ideas of one
who is to be life's dearest companion; besides, we have seen so little
of each other, and I cannot help feeling that this period of our life
is perhaps the sweetest and pleasantest we may ever experience. Married
life will bring cares and responsibilities with it, and I would prolong
my present happiness as long as possible. You must not be angry with me
for saying this, dear Albert, or for being rather reluctant to exchange
happy certainty for the unknown future. My mother will not influence me
either way, but allows me to judge for myself. She will be happy to see
you here when you can arrange to come to us for a few days, and you and
I can then talk the matter over, and perhaps your arguments may prove
more convincing than mine, in which case I shall give way.</p>

<p class="right">N&mdash;&mdash;, November 30, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear Albert:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">A few weeks ago, when I promised that our marriage should take place
in December, I fully intended to keep my word, but on consideration,
feel compelled to ask you to let it be postponed for a few months
longer. I have no good reason to urge for this delay&mdash;perhaps I am
over-sensitive and anxious, but still, if you would agree to it I
should be very grateful. It strikes me we entered upon our engagement
rather hastily, and that I was persuaded against my better judgment to
fix next month for our marriage. I think it will be better for both of
us that we should endeavor to learn more of each other's tastes, and
what each requires of the other. Your line of life is so decided that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
I wish to be certain it will suit me exactly, or that you would meet
me in some degree with little concessions to my individual tastes. I
have written to you out of the fullness of my heart, and trust you will
not misunderstand me, or think I do not love you. My request is for a
little more time, which I am sure you will not refuse me.</p>

<p class="noin">Dearest Alva:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">Do you not realize how miserable you make me by the way you have acted
recently? You cannot suppose it is very pleasant for me to see you,
day after day, encouraging the attentions of other men. At the party
last night you appeared to prefer every man in the room to myself
as partner. If you acted in this way with the idea of arousing my
jealousy, let me tell you it is a very dangerous game to play at; but I
imagine nothing so flattering to myself was intended, and that a love
of admiration and indifference to my feelings were the motives that
actuated you. If this is the case, it would be best for both of us that
our engagement should be at an end; if, however, you are able to assure
me that you meant nothing by your thoughtless coquetry beyond the
amusement of the moment, you shall never again hear a word of reproach
from me on the subject, and I will trust you as fully as before.</p>

thinking this is the case. I feel you are very much changed, your
manner to me at times almost amounting to indifference. Your letters
are short and cold, and but few words of affection can be extracted
from them. I am beginning to think you no longer care for me; perhaps
this is what you wish me to understand. And yet it is hard to believe
this of you; it must be that something or some one has estranged you
from me, and that an explanation between us will put things on their
former footing; anyhow, I give you now the opportunity of telling

you have pained and hurt me by the attentions you so constantly offer
to Mrs. Dunstable? I do not suppose you mean to vex me, and have no

little less <i>empressé</i> in your manner to her. You will think perhaps
that I am jealous; it is not quite that, but yet I have a sort of
feeling that you ought not to be so nice to her. You will not be angry
with me for saying this, dear Charles; it is my great love for you
that causes me to attach such importance to every look and word of
yours, and to feel reluctant that other women should share them with
me. You must not say that this argues a want of trust in you unworthy
of us both; indeed, I do trust you, otherwise my self-respect would
not allow me to write so frank a letter as this one is. Perhaps I have
only to tell you what is in my heart for you to give me no further

once for all, that I detest jealousy in a woman, and should soon cease
to care for one who tormented me by repetition of such accusations.
If, during our engagement, you are to feel aggrieved at my offering
the slightest civility to any lady of my acquaintance, what chance of
happiness is there in store for us in married life? I can see nothing
but wretchedness ahead if you persist in giving way to this feeling;
dismiss it from your mind, it is not worthy of you, and remember that
perfect trust is what I expect and desire from the one who is to become
my wife. I feel strongly on the subject, as so much alienation and
misery are occasioned by unfounded jealousy.</p>

suppose it is so from the way you allow Mr. Small to devote himself

than, under the circumstances, you ought to receive from any man

or he is dishonorable enough to act thus in spite of it. If you have
not sufficient regard for my feelings and for your own position as my
promised wife, to put an end at once to any further acquaintance with
Mr. Small, you will understand that I resign all pretensions to your

<p>Is it not better, in a matter that concerns the happiness of two
lives, to undo a mistake at any cost than to wait until too late? We
thought once that we truly loved each other, but we have found, during
the period of our engagement, that in many grave respects we are not
congenial. Our tastes, our aims in life, our ideals are so diverse,
that I believe our union could not be perfectly happy. When you review
in your mind the occurrences of the past <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>months, I am sure you will
agree with me. It is not necessary to place the blame. Perhaps there
has been no fault but hastiness. Considering everything, I would

continue as far as seems agreeable and natural. We shall have many

there was nothing else for us to do but to close our doors and put our

SOCIAL INTERCOURSE</h2>
<hr class="small" />
<h3>CHAPTER I
<br />
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS</h3>

<p>The act of writing a social letter is to many people a task of some
little difficulty from various points of view. They are at a loss as
to the most fitting manner in which to express that which they have to
communicate, and one, two, and three sheets of note paper often bear
witness to their attempts and failures. Either at the commencement or
at the finish, it strikes them that something is not as it should be,
or, right in the middle, they come to a deadlock altogether. Others,
again, have not the intelligence to discover for themselves that their
letter is not up to the regulation standard of notes in general, and
have to face criticism and even ridicule. In writing letters, it is
curious to observe how closely certain sets of words and expressions
are followed by the generality of people; they accept them as models,
and adhere to them. But phrases in letter writing change, as everything
else changes, and what was strictly polite and proper to write under
given circumstances some twenty or thirty years ago is not quite the
thing to say to-day.</p>

<p>To commence a letter to a comparative stranger, or to a person with
whom the writer is but slightly acquainted, is the first difficulty
to overcome. Shall it be a letter or a note, written in the first or
in the third person? This is to many a perplexing question, and yet
there need be no doubt on this point, as there are safe rules for every
one's guidance in such matters. In all communications with strangers,
it would be correct to write in the third person. A very slight
acquaintance, however, would authorize a letter being written in the
first person if it were to be of any length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
It is an accomplishment to write a good letter, and one of which few
can boast, while to write a bad one is so general a practice that the
receipt of a good letter almost amounts to an agreeable surprise. With
regard to the composition of a letter, it should always be remembered
that if it has a reason for being written, this fact should not be
lost sight of or over-weighted with a mass of extraneous matter. It
is also idle to devote the first paragraph of a letter to trivial
excuses for not having written sooner, when a still longer delay
might have been allowed to elapse if it suited the convenience of the
writer; still, when a letter requires an immediate answer, it is a
matter of politeness to give the reason for the delay, but this should
be explained without circumlocution. It is when girls are merging
into womanhood and boys into manhood, that want of fluency in letter
writing is acutely felt; and this awkwardness often continues in after
years. Some are more conscious than others of their deficiencies in
this respect, and to write a letter or even a simple note is to them
a trouble and a bore; later on they take refuge in the fact that they
are bad correspondents, and they use this statement as an excuse for
writing very short letters or for not writing at all. Many people
confess when obliged to write letters, that they have no idea what to
say beyond the preliminary phrase; they are afraid to trust their pen
with their thoughts, for fear of getting out of their depth and of not
being able to recover themselves without becoming more or less involved
and hazy as to grammar. A well-expressed letter creates a pleasant
feeling of gratification; it is often read twice, and if not put by
amongst other missives, considered worth keeping, it is destroyed with
some regret. One charm of a good letter lies, perhaps, in its being
personally considerate; another, in its clearly calling to mind the
individuality of the writer.</p>

<p>Inquiries after health should be made with discretion, always
remembering that some are thin-skinned on this subject, while others
like to discuss it at length. A clever writer keeps his affairs very
much in the background unless they are at a crisis, when they would of
course possess interest of an unusual character; otherwise to relate
trivial matters for the sake of having something to say is foolish and
egotistical. In these days, people do not accuse themselves of writing
stupid, dull, or uninteresting letters, as their friends are only too
likely to take their confessions at their own valuation and to endorse
the written verdict; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>while the affectation of laying the blame of bad
writing on pens, ink, and paper is now considered as a most inadequate
and absurd excuse. In answering, it is a proof of a poor imagination
to minutely paraphrase each paragraph of the letter under treatment.
Questions naturally demand answers, and important facts call for
comment; but trivial remarks and observations, perhaps pleasantly put,
should not be returned to their author with poor platitudes attached to
them.</p>

<p>Letter-writing may be said to be divided into notes and letters.
Formerly a note written in the third person invariably commenced with,
"Mrs. Jones presents her compliments to Mrs. Brown"; but now the words
"presents compliments" have fallen into disfavor; and, whenever any
other opening phrase can be readily substituted, it is in better taste
to use it. Indeed, it may be taken as a rule that compliments are only
presented to a complete stranger, or officially, or professionally
speaking; and whenever an acquaintanceship exists, even of the
slightest possible character, other expressions are used in preference
to the words "presents her compliments." The nature of the note itself
would probably determine the most appropriate expression wherewith to
commence it.</p>

<p>There are few people careless or ignorant enough to lapse from the
third person into the first in the course of a short note; but still
it is worth guarding against. Notes are principally confined to the
briefest of communications, as the frequent and necessary repetition of
the pronouns&mdash;she and her, for instance&mdash;or the surnames of the writer
and recipient of the note becomes tedious; and when it is imperative
to write in the third person, it is most desirable to construct each
sentence with a due regard to an extravagant use of pronouns, and never
at any time to resort to the vulgar expedient of attempting a sort of
compromise by making the initial letter of the writer and of the person
written to do duty for their respective names and surnames.</p>

<p>It is observable that a cramped style, or a small Italian hand-writing,
is no longer in vogue, and, when seen, appears very much out of date.
The prevailing mode of writing is bold and free. A frequent use of
capitals is also indulged in, which gives a dash of originality and
spirit to a letter when not over-done.</p>

<p>It used to be an idea that to underline words in a letter was rather
bad style; but now, if a writer wishes to be very emphatic, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>or to call
particular attention to any remark, an additional stroke of the pen is
not objected to; it is a liberty not to be taken, however, when writing
to those with whom one is on ceremony.</p>

<p>Many people experience a certain difficulty in the choice of a
conventional term with which to conclude a ceremonious letter, and it
must be admitted that there is not much variety at command, "Yours
truly," "Yours sincerely," "Yours faithfully," "Yours obediently,"
with the addition perhaps of the adverb "very," being the principal
formulas in use; and it is on the whole immaterial whether "truly"
or "sincerely" is employed when writing to friends. The affectionate
expressions addressed to still dearer friends and relations are left
to one's personal feelings, and yet many devoted husbands make use of
the cold, formal words "Yours truly," when writing to their wives, in
preference to any more endearing phrase.</p>

<p>In order not to conclude a letter too abruptly, it is usual, before
the words "Yours truly," to add one or other of such phrases as these:
"Believe me, dear Mrs. Jones," or "I remain, dear Mrs. Jones," or
"Believe me, dear Mrs. Jones, with kind regards," and this gives to
a letter a certain finish and completeness which would otherwise be
wanting.</p>

<p>An error of punctuation in a letter will often cause a sentence or
paragraph to be misunderstood, and made to convey the reverse of what
was intended.</p>

<p>Question marks should not be omitted from a letter when questions
are asked, though many consider it a waste of time to use them. An
exclamation point, when required, materially assists the clearer
understanding of a passage, which without it might not possess so
emphatic a meaning.</p>

<p>Another practice of the past, now happily discarded, is that of
crossing letters; only a school girl, nowadays, would cross and recross
a sheet of writing paper, and two sheets of paper are used if one sheet
will not contain all that is to be said. If half the second sheet
of paper is left blank it is not torn off, a whole sheet being more
convenient to hold and to fold, and if a few last words are necessary
for the completion of a letter they are written on the margin and not
across the writing on the face of the pages.</p>

<p>In social correspondence it is, often, considered good form to write on
the first and third pages of a sheet of note paper, leaving the second
and fourth pages blank, or to write on the fourth and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>first pages,
leaving the other two unwritten upon. This is done for the convenience
of having the letters written without using a blotting pad. A
postscript was formerly supposed to convey the pith or gist of a lady's
letter&mdash;a poor compliment, it must be confessed, to her intelligence;
it is now considered a vulgarism to put P. S. at the bottom of a letter
containing the few last words; if something is remembered when the
letter is concluded that should have been said, it is added without the
two capitals in question.</p>

<p>In addressing envelopes, the address should be written legibly in the
center of the envelope, and not run off into the corner, leaving a
third of the envelope blank.</p>

<div class="vertical"><p class="center p2"><i>Angular Handwriting</i></p>

<p><i>This is a sample of Ladies' Angular hand. It is perfectly legible
when written correctly, is capable of great rapidity, and should be

<p>The bearer, Mr. Phillip Allen Taylor, of this city, having retired

cherished dream of his to visit, when released from business cares, the
chief cities of his native land, and especially to wander through the
majestic scenery of the far West. His plan has extended of late, and,
unless the fatigues of travel should prove detrimental to his health,
he may visit China and Japan, spend a winter in India, and return home
by way of Europe. If in the course of these wanderings he should be
fortunate enough to meet any of my numerous friends, especially in
Florence, Paris, London or Glasgow, I trust this note will serve as a
kindly introduction. Mr. Taylor is a whole-souled gentleman, and any

boy, but he is now leaving the quietude and shelter of a country home
to face the varied and testing experiences of life in a great city. We
have no fear but he will conduct himself in a manner worthy of his home
and of his early training; at the same time I feel it my duty to do
all in my power to secure for him the best influences and the happiest
surroundings; and have, therefore, allowed myself to send him directly
to you. He has been urged by me to attend your church, and we shall all
be very grateful if you will introduce him to the young people of your
congregation. He will probably feel lonely for a little while, but my
mind will be much at rest concerning him if I know that he is forming
wise and helpful friendships. I shall be very grateful for any kindness
shown to my boy as he starts out to fight the battle of life.</p>

<p class="right">L&mdash;&mdash;, August 17, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="noin">My Esteemed Old Friend:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">We were exceedingly pained to learn from the newspapers of yesterday
that, after a long struggle, you have been compelled to yield to the
resistless pressure of these hard times. Success in business is often
a mere accident and merits little praise, and in like manner, failure
in business is often the sad and only return for a long and patient
fight against tremendous odds. In these days of merciless competition,
the spirit of fair trading seems to be almost buried out of sight. It
is no longer a case of "the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>survival of the fittest," so much as of
the survival of "the smartest." But we should not let undeserved defeat
bring despair. As the poet says:</p>

<p class="center">"Hope springs eternal in the human breast,"</p>

<p class="noin">and I most sincerely trust there are brighter days in store for you. We
feel sure you can have nothing to blame yourself for in these reverses.
Everybody who knows Alfred Baker knows that he is the soul of honor,
that he holds integrity by the right hand and by the left.</p>

<p>I exceedingly regret that my letter must be one of words only, and wish
it were possible to ask you to draw upon me for some useful, helpful
amount. But that is utterly beyond my power. Letters are not of much
value in such a crisis as you are now passing through, and yet we could
not keep silent.</p>

<p>Pray accept these few words of heartfelt sympathy. Be brave! Be
hopeful! Better days will come.</p>

The landlady of the boarding house where she is staying seems very
attentive and kind, still it would certainly be a great comfort to Mrs.
Lord if you could bring her sister down with you. In the meantime, I

<p>I was deeply distressed to learn from your niece, Gertrude, of your

inscrutable, and all we can do is to bow in submission to the Divine

anger, but are proofs of a loving Father's care. "His paths are in
the sea, and His footsteps are in the deep waters." He causeth "all
things to work together for good" to those who put their trust in Him.
But I need not remind you of these sources of comfort in the day of

suggest to you a thousand secret springs of gracious consolation. It

write of my sorrow as yet. I feel too broken-hearted to do anything but
sit down and cry helplessly. Of course I ought to rouse myself, but the
knowledge that he has gone from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>me forever, and that henceforward I
shall be alone, deprived of his loving care, is all that I can realize.
By and by my duty toward my child will give me something to live for,
but at present I can only mourn, and pray for resignation.</p>

<p class="noin">Dear Mr. Stevens:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">It seems almost cruel to intrude upon you in your great sorrow, but I
cannot delay writing how much my husband and myself sympathize with
you. We saw the announcement of the death of your dear wife in the
"Journal," and were greatly shocked, as we had not even heard of her
illness. Pray do not think of answering this letter; I only wanted to
say that our hearts are with you, in this severe bereavement, the more
sad since your dear little girls are thus deprived at so tender an age
of a loving mother's care.</p>

My dear wife's death has left me utterly miserable, and her loss to

<p class="noin">My Dear Mrs. Heywood:&mdash;</p>

<p>I was deeply concerned to read, in the Paris edition of the "N&mdash;&mdash;
Y&mdash;&mdash; H&mdash;&mdash;," about the death of your brother. Although you have not
seen much of him of late years, still of course his loss must have
been a great shock to you. I remember him a handsome, most promising
young fellow; how sad that he should thus be cut off in the prime of
life! Have you heard any particulars beyond the fact of his death? I
suppose his poor young wife will return at once to her own people, as
he has left two children. I am truly grieved for you all; and with kind
regards,</p>

<p class="noin">Dear Mr. Saunderson:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in10">Please accept my most earnest thanks for your kind letter of
condolence. My poor brother's unexpected death was indeed a great shock
to us. All that we have as yet heard is that he was ill only three
days, and that enteric fever was the cause of death; his wife was too
overwhelmed with grief to write more fully, but we trust we shall hear
from her by next mail. Her father is very anxious that she should
come back to us at once with her children. John and I were such great
friends up to the time of his marriage, it seems too sad to think that
I shall never see him again; we were fond and proud of him too, and his
sudden death is inexpressibly terrible to us all.</p>

<p class="noin">My Dear Margaret:&mdash;</p>

<p>I was deeply grieved to hear from you of the death of your dear mother,
and I can well imagine how greatly you must miss her every hour.
You have one consolation, however, that of having been the best of
daughters to her, and having given her the most devoted care during her
long illness. In such a trial as this, little can be said to comfort
you, and time alone will soften your sorrow for the loss of the kindest
of mothers. In her death I have lost a dear friend, and indeed all who
knew her cannot fail to regret one who was so amiable and unselfish.
Have you made any plans as yet, and what does your brother wish you to
do?&mdash;are you to live with him or with one of your mother's relatives?
I shall be much interested to hear what you propose doing, and if you
would care to come to us for a quiet visit, do not hesitate to say
so. Mr. Standish unites with me in sending you and your brother the
expression of our profound sympathy.</p>

<p class="in10">I never felt so much at a loss to express my feelings. If only I could
tell you all that is in my heart! It seems to me that in the presence
of your great grief, silence is the only suitable offering. How deeply
I sympathize with you no words of mine can tell, and to utter the
common words of condolence would serve no end in your case.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><div class="i0">"For common is the common place,</div>

<p>One only hope can comfort you in these sad hours, the hope that
somewhere in the "many mansions" of our "Father's house," the daughter
who loved you with all the sweetness of her early <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>affection loves you
still. The shadows of the valley of death cannot eclipse the light of
love.</p>

<p>Time, the great healer, will bring balm to your wounded spirit. I have
just been reading the poems of Horatius Bonar, and I recall a stanza
of his that expresses better than any words of mine could do the calm,
divine hope of a reunion of the loved and lost in that fair land that
lies beyond the boundaries of time. It runs thus:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><div class="i0">"Where the faded flower shall blossom,</div>
<div class="i0">Blossom never more to fade;</div>
<div class="i0">Where the shaded sky shall brighten,</div>
<div class="i0">Brighten never more to shade,</div>
<div class="i0">Where the child shall meet her mother</div>
<div class="i0">And the mother meet her child;</div>
<div class="i0">And dear families be gathered,</div>

PART VI</h2>

<h3>THE CORRECT FORMS OF VISITING CARDS, INVITATIONS, ETC.</h3>
<hr class="small" />
<h4>VISITING CARDS</h4>

<p><b>Gentlemen's Cards.</b>&mdash;Plain, cream white, thin cardboard, no ornaments,
no fancy writing. Use simple engraved script, printed in black. Size of
card, 3 × 1½ inches.</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
 <p class="center"><i><big>Mr. Edward Hale Davies,</big></i></p>

<p class="right p2"><i>2010 Wheeler Avenue.</i></p></div>

<p class="p2">Use sparingly titles or "handles" to your name, such as Hon., General,
Colonel, Dr. Army titles ought not really to be used when the bearer
has not seen real service. If he is, or has been, in the regular army,
he should have his visiting card read as follows:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>
<div class="bbox"> <p class="center"><i><big>Col. Hugh Dalrymple, U. S. A.,</big></i></p>

<p class="right p2"><i>Calumet Club.</i></p></div>

<p class="p2">A physician had better use for his "private," not "professional," card
the following form:</p>

<div class="bbox">
 <p class="center"><i><big>George D. Smith, M. D.,</big></i></p>

<p class="right p2"><i>1703 Michigan Boulevard.</i></p></div>

<p class="p2">It is better form still to omit lettering occupations altogether. The
abbreviation Rev. is allowable in front of a clergyman's name, even if
followed by the letters D.D.</p>

<p>Do not forget, if you are neither an officer, nor a clergyman, nor a
medical practitioner, to prefix your name by Mr. Should you, however,
desire to write your name on a card to "send up" to the person you are
calling on, omit the Mr.</p>

<p>Cards are "due"&mdash;that is, must be delivered in person&mdash;to the host
and hostess&mdash;one for each, after having enjoyed their hospitality at
some formal function, dinner, ball, musicale, etc. If prevented from
calling, a note must accompany the cards and be sent by messenger. Such
cards are also "due" after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span> first invitation which you have been
obliged to decline. These formal calls must be made within a week after
the event.</p>

<p>Cards may be sent "by mail" in acknowledgment of an invitation to a
church wedding; or, with the mention "congratulations" written by hand
to one whose engagement is announced, or who is the father of a newly
born baby. Cards of condolence, with the written words "with deepest
sympathy," may be mailed (but, better, left in person) in cases of
sorrow or bereavement.</p>

<p>Men rarely exchange cards, nowadays. However, a visitor in your
city may be welcomed at his hotel by the cards of acquaintances
that may have been half forgotten. Then, if he cares to renew the
erstwhile intercourse, he calls or returns the cards. After formal
"stag-parties," if a guest is not an intimate friend, it would be good
form for him to leave a card at his entertainer's club or residence.
In large cities this is done quite generally, as people there are
more formal in their social ways. It is well, at all times, for one
to remember that "courtesy in little things is a sure sign of good
breeding."</p>

<p><b>Ladies' Cards.</b>&mdash;As to color, printing, etc., the rules relating to
gentlemen's visiting cards are to be followed. The size of a lady's
card is fixed just now by custom at about 3⅛ × 2¼ inches.</p>

<p>If the lady is the oldest married woman in the oldest branch of the
family she may omit any Christian name on her card; thus:</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
   <p class="center"><i><big>Mrs. Stewart,</big></i></p>

<p class="right p2"><i> 25 Astor Place</i>.</p></div>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
In any other case her card must contain her husband's full name, thus:</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
<p class="center"><i><big>Mrs. James Gold Stewart, </big></i></p>

<p class="right p2"><i>25 Astor Place.</i></p></div>

<p class="p2">During the first year of married life&mdash;i. e., during the period when
husband and wife, just returned from their honeymoon trip, are calling
together upon their friends and society acquaintances, they will use
the following card; the day, in the left corner, indicating when they
will be at home to their friends:</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
 <p class="center"><i><big>Mr. and Mrs. James Gold Stewart,</big></i></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="floatl"><i>Mondays.</i></span>   <span class="floatr"><i>25 Astor Place.</i></span></p></div>

<p class="p2">Otherwise, it is usual when the wife returns formal calls, and does so
alone, for her to leave with her own card two of her <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>husband's, one
each for the lady and gentleman of the house she is visiting. If there
are young ladies, in the house, who are already "out"&mdash;i. e., received
in society, she will add one more of her own cards.</p>

<p>Young ladies are not supposed to use cards, at least until they are out
of their teens. When they are "out," their names are added on their
mother's card.</p>

<p>After the young lady has been "in society" at least two seasons she may
have her personal visiting cards, but without address. In that case the
elder or eldest daughter of the family uses the family name without
Christian name.</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
<p class="center"><big><i>Mrs. James Gold Stewart,</i></big>
<br />
     <i>The Misses Stewart</i></p>

         <p class="p2 right">25 Astor Place.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="bbox"><p class="center"><i>Miss Stewart.</i></p></div>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
The younger daughters prefix their Christian name to the family name.</p>

<p>The day of the week when the lady is "at home" to her friends in the
afternoon is inserted in the left-hand corner of the card. Sometimes
the lady prefers to limit these receptions to certain days, then the
card reads:</p>
<div class="bbox p2">
<p class="center"><i><big>Mrs. James Gold Stewart,</big></i></p>

 <p class="p2 noin"><i>First and Third</i><br />
 <i>Fridays in January, </i><br />
 <i>February and March.</i>
</p>
<p class="right"><i>25 Astor Place.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="p2"><b>Mourning Visiting Cards</b>, with a black border of varied breadth,
according to nearness of relationship, are very properly used, sizes
and styles being otherwise identical. However, it is in bad taste to
inscribe a reception day on a mourning card, as one is supposed to
decline all calls except from intimate friends. In fact, mourning cards
are mostly used to return thanks "by mail" to people sending condolence
cards.</p>

<p><b>Cards of Introduction.</b>&mdash;Ordinary visiting cards are used for that
purpose, with the addition of some such words written at the bottom:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Introducing Archibald Monroe, Esq.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Such cards must be enclosed in an envelope addressed to the person to
whom the introduction is made, but left open when delivered to the
person one wants to introduce.</p>

<h4>INVITATION CARDS</h4>

<p><b>Cards for Social Functions.</b>&mdash;These are specially engraved for the
occasion, a good size being about 4 × 2½ inches; cream white Bristol
board, absolutely plain engraving. On the left-hand corner the object
of the invitation is stated: <i>Music</i>, for a musicale; <i>Dancing</i>, for a
dancing party, etc.</p>
<div class="bbox p2">
<p class="center"><i><big>Mrs. James Gold Stewart,</big><br />
       At Home,<br />
 Tuesday Evening, February Second.</i></p>

 <p class="p2"><span class="floatl"><i>Music.</i></span>      <span class="floatr"><i>25 Astor Place.</i></span></p>
</div>
<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
If the function is given in honor of some distinguished guest, the
invitation is generally worded as follows:</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
<p class="center"><i><big>Mr. and Mrs. James Gold Stewart</big>
<br />
    request the pleasure of
<br />
  .............................'s
<br />
   company on Tuesday evening,
<br />
 February Second, at nine o'clock.
<br />

   <big>Lord Willoughby d'Eresby</big>,
<br />
 British Ambassador to Washington.</i></p>

 <p class="p2"><span class="floatl">R. S. V. P.</span>   <span class="floatr">25 Astor Place.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2">The name of the guest is written with pen on the dotted line. The
letters R. S. V. P. stand for the French words, "Repondez, s'il vous
plait," meaning in English: "Answer, if you please."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Of course, a reply is to be returned at once.</p>

<p>Here is the most usually employed form for an invitation to dinner.
The name and date are to be filled by hand. In that way one engraved
plate is enough for all dinner parties. Another card, worded the same,
with "luncheon" inserted in place of "dinner," and the hour changed to
"half-past one," is the "correct thing" for invitations to a luncheon.</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
<p class="center"><i><big>Mr. and Mrs. James Gold Stewart</big>
<br />
    request the pleasure of
<br />
  ...........................'s

<br />
 company at dinner on .............
<br />
 ..................at seven o'clock.</i></p>

 <p class="p2"><span class="floatl">R. S. V. P. </span>  <span class="floatr">25 Astor Place.</span></p></div>

<p class="p2">For such an important function as a "ball"&mdash;i. e., a dancing party on
a particularly elaborate scale&mdash;double sheets of thick, medium size,
cream white note, are generally used; the hour must not be earlier than
9:30, and on the lower left corner the words "Dancing at Eleven" are
to be inserted. Sometimes the hostess adds: "Fancy dress de rigueur";
meaning that all the guests are expected to appear in fancy costumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
<b>Wedding Cards.</b>&mdash;Ought to be issued by the bride's family at least two
weeks before the wedding takes place.</p>

<p>If it is to be a church wedding the following invitation on a double
sheet of note paper is correct:</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
<p class="center"><i><big>Mr. and Mrs. Edward Hall</big>
<br />
    request your presence
<br />
 at the marriage of their daughter
<br />
      <big>Eleanor Augusta</big>
<br />
         to
<br />
    <big>Mr. George Gordon Lewis</big>
<br />
   Saturday morning, June first
<br />
     at twelve o'clock
<br />
    St. Margaret Church.</i></p></div>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
A more formal invitation to a wedding reception is engraved thus and
printed on a double sheet note of paper.</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
<p class="center"><i><big>Mr. and Mrs. James Allen Stanton</big>
<br />
    have the honour of announcing
<br />
   the marriage of their daughter,
<br />
    <big>Marietta Bland Davidson</big>,<br />
          to<br />
   <big> Mr. Edward Taylor White</big>,
<br />
    on Thursday, January third
<br />
    nineteen hundred and one.
<br />
    <big>Church of the Incarnation</big>,
<br />
      Buffalo, New York.</i>
</p>

    <p class="p2"> <i>At Home<br />
 after February fifteenth,<br />
   Omaha, Nebraska.</i></p></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_237.jpg" width="414" height="600" alt="" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
In the same envelope a select number of friends should receive the
following additional invitation on a card:</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
<p class="center"><i><big>Reception</big><br />
     from half-past twelve<br />
      until three o'clock.</i></p>

           <p class="right p2">1001 Pine Avenue.</p></div>

<p class="p2">Should it be expected that the general public might crowd the church to
the point of inconvenience, a small, neat, engraved card may be added
to the two others, worded as follows:</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
<p class="center"><i>Please present this card at<br />
     St. Margaret Church,<br />

     Saturday, June first,<br />

      at twelve o'clock.</i></p></div>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
For a silver or golden wedding an invitation on note paper will be
correct if worded as follows, and engraved without any flourishes:</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
<p class="center"><span class="floatl">1871.</span>
<span class="border">Monogram. </span>
<span class="floatr">1896.</span></p>

<br />
     <i>Tuesday, June twelfth,</i>

      <i>from four until six,</i>
<br />
  <i>and from nine until eleven o'clock.</i></p>

             <p class="right">3051 Elm Street.</p></div>

<h5>WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES</h5>

<ul><li>The first anniversary is called the cotton wedding.</li>
<li>The second, the paper wedding.</li>

<h4>LEAVE-TAKING</h4>

<p>It is customary, although not quite as generally done as formerly, to
leave or mail visiting cards to all one's mere acquaintances (friends
being notified by visit or letter), when about to either change one's
habitual residence or undertake a journey of some duration. Ordinary
visiting cards are used with the letters P. P. C. written on the
left-hand corner. These are the initials of the French phrase, "Pour
prendre congé," meaning "To take leave." The custom is commendable. A
separate card ought to be sent for each grown-up member of the family.</p>

<h4>NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS AND FUNERALS</h4>

<p>Sometimes, to announce to acquaintances the arrival of a little
stranger, a tiny card is engraved with the baby's name and the date of
his birth, thus:</p>

<div class="bbox p2">
<p class="center p2"><i>Harold Jay Stewart,</i></p>

 <p class="p2"><span class="floatl"><i>May first.</i></span>
     <span class="floatr"><i>25 Astor Place.</i></span></p>

</div>
<p class="p2">Or a notification by the parents may be sent, engraved on note paper.</p>

<p class="center">AN AMUSING LETTER</p>

<p>The following letter in "<span class="err" title="original: buba">babu</span>" English, composed by a Hindoo graduate
of Calcutta University is reproduced here <i>for amusement rather than
for imitation</i>:</p>

<p>"To Babu Kaly Churan Ghose, Paternal Father of Miss Churan Ghose.
Dear Sir:&mdash;It is with faltering penmanship that I write to have
communication with you about the prospective condition of your
damsel offspring. For remote time past secret passion has firing my
bosom internally with loving for your daughter.</p>

<p>I have traveled all channels in the magnitude of my extensive
jurisdiction cruelly to smother the growing love-knot that is
being constructed within my inside, but the timid lamp of my
affection, trimmed by Cupid's productive hands still nourishes my
love-sickened breast.</p>

<p>Needless would it be for me to numerically extemporize the
great conflagration that has generated in my head and heart.
During the region of nightness my intellectual cranium has been
entangled in thoughtful attitude for my beloved consort. Nocturnal
slumberlessness has been the infirmity which has besieged my now
degenerate constitution.</p>

<p>My educational abilities have abandoned me, and now I cling to
those lovely long tresses for your much coveted daughter like
mariner shipwrecked on rock of love.</p>

<p>As to my scholastic calabre, I was recently ejected from Calcutta
University. I am now masticating and will make a motion as soon as
I can perceive the business of life a little laxative.</p>

<p>I am of lofty and original lineage and independent incomes and
hoping that having debated proposition in your pregnant mind you
will concordantly corroborate in espousing your female progeny to
my tender bosom and thereby acquire me into your family circle as
yours faithful son-in-law.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
